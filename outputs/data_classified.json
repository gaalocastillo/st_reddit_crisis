I say I\u2019m from Bahrain because I\u2019m most affiliated with it I know decent Arabic and have been 10+ times whilst idk anything ab my dad\u2019s side. I wish my mom never chose my dad to have kids because in short he is an idiot too. He\u2019s a pedo and a serial cheater, I don\u2019t talk to him. I\u2019m 19 and still suffer with hating my skin. I\u2019m brown but I\u2019m not insanely dark, but not light brown either. Say the same as someone half black half white. My dad always treated my sister better than me because she\u2019s so much whiter she could pass for caucasian. I never got the treatment she got just because my dad was insecure of this too and took it out on us. I\u2019ve always grown up hating it and now I\u2019m in wales for uni and have a job but the area where my job is is so dominated by white people. I feel so uncomfortable I\u2019m like one of 3 coloured people working there out of 120. I get dirty looks and weird stares and I hate it I\u2019m so anxious of this. I have curly hair maybe 3b? I love it so much thankfully its something idc about people thinking it\u2019s different but its still something uncommon and it contributes in a way to this insecurity. I want to bleach my skin at least to be somewhat lighter because I can\u2019t do this anymore white people are so beautiful and I also think brown and black people are too but not for me personally I feel likr such a troll and I\u2019ve broken down over this now and I try to think it\u2019s fine I\u2019m pretty and even Jesus was brown but he wasn\u2019t even brown was he? He was more Mediterranean not filthy like me. ",

        "selftext": "Hello, this is the story i wish to share with everyone : \nIve met this person on yubo back in september 2024, and we really had thay great alchemy going on for awhile : we were almost texting tons and tons of messages to each others, sending voicenotes about our dreams, they were telling me of their sufferings bc there ex of long relationship had cheated on them in august, and i always wanted to cheer them up the best i could, even just through memes, reels and messages. \nUnderstand this person and i lived to 2 different countries but as the firsf months we talked, we were just buddies from internet nothing more.\n\nAs the months went by, a bit out of nowhere, suddenly, i felt a massive urge of emotions for them : i couldnt really explain : when ive known them i was in a era of my life where it thought \"im cooked for life to be alone forever\" and as we talked \"wow this person gets me so much weve got so much in commkn and they are not just a listener to my neverending yapping but also a good talker\" to a point where \"not once have i kicked my feet and giggled like a toddler when receiving messages from them\" they were my dopamine. But i didnt wanted to ruin anything with my feelings, so i kept it down and planned on how tl confess properly : after all, they were in another country we couldnt meet irl. How could i ever compete against the guys that can see them on a daily basis at the bar, the concerts, the good looking ones with abs, hair, goth / alt style, the bikers, the freaky ones etc etc. How can k show my determination, my devotion, my goodwill to \"i dont want to rush things out, lets go one pedal at a time but i still want you to know im serious about this and wont leave you lkke your ex or any fboys would\" and boom : i started writing my very first poems for them, i planned on the side a massive package with letters of countless words, about 8 drawings and more with texts on the back representing us as adventurers, me giving out my heart (ill spare the drawing details unless some are interested on what i wanted to send, which i could send here as well as the letters but for example some were filled with corny lines like \"let me set myself ablaze so i may keep you warm\" aaaah lines) i wanted to add a plushie i saw them like on insta and get it delivered to their post office, a bouquet with thejr favorite flowers and some papercrafts letters or boxes full of passion and good for them. I wanted even a necklace they hand made and have it as a keepsake and they did told me once thehd be happy to offer it to me, just to pay for tbe delivery fees. Jeez i was even planning tk travel to their country first for some 2 weeks holidays to finally meet and prove i was really invested into them and it was no fluke.\nThing is they were smart, too smart and understood with the flow of conversation what i intended to do. And so one random night while k was at work, on a very busy night shift were i had alot going on, they called and said \"i understand ure planning to asking me out, but rn, im not looking for anyone\" ill pass on the details of how heartbroken i felt bc my emotions took over and fc our friendshio bc, ever since that called 2 weeks past the day i write this, they nevee been the same : id be leff on delivered for hours, days even if i wasnt trying to call just so my messages wouldnt be buried  by the new ones, dry messages, always somehow being busy even though a few min later i would seem them on discord playing with someone else for hours, i would see them post a story or be online but totally ignore my messages like i was on mute, while theh woukd publicly show in their story the convo with people theh would have km the instant. No more reels sent, no more conversation, like i never was there. At first i griefed of what could have been, i griefed something and someone i wasnt even dating. \nAftwr watchjng some videos on ytbe and doing some online tests, it finally clicked : i was lovebombing them, which is quite the red flag from what i heard. I was jn total limerence kf that fantasy ive built in my head of the what if, the possibilities the over romanticism for them, the endless nights fucking mg sleep schedule for them. I was sad for a scenario ive built in my own head, i was feedkng myself with an alternate universe. And even though k never meant to harm or go strongly on them like that, bc i was so eager to prove my worth for them, to beat the racd from tbe other mens courting or flirting with them, ive fumbled hard. To this day, i wanted tk apologize to them and truly tell them how i felt about this but j keep being ignored, yet everytime i do get a text back, it says they arent mad, theh dont wsnt to cht contact od ghost me,\"they even keep some previous lovers and ex by their side and talks to them. And i tokk those breadcrumbs and fed even more so my dopamjne into that. Now i have now news anymore and. Ive lost a great friend that uplifted me mentally and changed me for the better. \nNow jm full of regrets and sorrow, ive crked my heart out for them but mostly mg self sabotage. \nWhat im trying to say now reddit viewers is,, i want to change my love mindset i dont want to be a lovebomber, i dont want to have that attachment anxious, that overthinking, that fear of abandonment. I want to fix myself and learn to be with no ill luggages in my mind. Im planning to see a therapist for other reasons but i will add this aswell. But yeah, anyone who knows how to work on not being a lovebomber, not falling in love too hard for anyone whos just kind to you? I dont want to repeat the same mistake twice if i were to fall inlove again.. thank you for reading all that, first time i post on reddit. ",

        "selftext": "Link to previous updates\u2014 follow the links to get to the original like Nomai clues in the game:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/outerwilds/s/akq0STHo8a\n\n\nI knew a few things about Dark Bramble.  I had shot my scout in the seed on Timber Hearth, and read about the angler fish on Ember Twin.  That\u2019s primarily the reason I have avoided exploring Dark Bramble, plus I had not felt anything calling me there as much as the other planets.\n\n\nI have a few theories about Dark Bramble.  One, the seeds are bigger on the inside than the outside, so I think Dark Bramble will be much bigger than it looks.  Two, the seeds are invasive to other planets in the solar system and somehow connect back to Dark Bramble.  I hypothesize that the Anglerfish fossil ended up on Ember Twin via a transport seed or something.\n\n\nFirst thing, I shot my scout into the seed on Timber Hearth.  Then I followed the duplicate signal to Dark Bramble.  My autopilot slightly crashed me into the Interloper on the way, but nothing I couldn\u2019t fix.  I pulled out my signal scope to find Feldspar\u2019s Harmonica.  I was right there but Feldspar was still so far away! I entered the foggy core of the planet.  Where were the anglerfish?  It was so foggy all I could see was dots of lights.  Could I use my thrusters now without attracting the fish? I decided to play it safe and just drift.  I eventually approached some fish.  I was going to bump right into them!  I ever so slightly used my thrusters but got eaten. Try again\u2026\n\n\nThis time I drifted even though I thought I would bump the fish. It got so nerve-wracking close, but didn\u2019t disturb them. I used my signal scope and the soothing tones of Feldspar\u2019s harmonica is what kept my nerves calm.  I eventually found Feldspar.  I talked to them, found their ship, found the jellyfish, and learned about the insulation.  I have to exit my ship and literally go inside the jellyfish to get into the Giant\u2019s Deep core.  Ew.\n\n\nAnyway, I headed back to Giant\u2019s Deep, and did just that.  Just as I suspected, the Probe tracking module was in the core.  I am blown away by what I discovered! 9,318,142 probes have been launched.  The Eye of the Universe was apparently discovered as an anomaly on launch 9,318,054.  Now, I haven\u2019t been keeping track of how many loops I\u2019ve done, but 88 seems about right.  If this means what I think it means\u2026 HAVE I ACTUALLY BEEN IN OVER 9 MILLION LOOPS AND CAN ONLY REMEMBER 88 OF THEM?!  Has the sun turned supernova over 9 million times?  Was the Probe\u2019s discovery of the Eye of the Universe what triggered the statues?! If so, how incredibly lucky I was to be walking by the statue at that moment.  Was it coincidence?  Why is this happening? \n\n\nI can\u2019t help but linger on the thought of living through 9 million loops and not even realizing it. My first loop after the statue linked with me, I went to Attlerock, exited my spaceship, and promptly suffocated because I didn\u2019t have my spacesuit on.  If this 9 million loops theory is true, I have died on Attlerock because I forgot my spacesuit over 9 million times.  That is depressing, and kind of hilarious\u2026 \n\n\nActually, I died before the statue linked with me by accidentally falling off a cliff, and got a \u201cYou Are Dead\u201d screen, roll credits.  Imagine doing that 9 million times.  Now the discovery of all this stuff I guess would be up to Gabbro since they\u2019re the only other Hearthian linked to a statue, and they don\u2019t seem particularly bothered to do anything.  Would the universe just keep looping forever and ever? Poor Gabbro. \n\n\nIt\u2019s me though.  I have to figure out what these coordinates mean and how they can take me to the Eye of the Universe. I feel like this is the ramblings of a mad person. I feel like I can sense the end, but there are just a few threads missing. The Eye of the Universe is somewhere in this solar system.  Why? The Nomai picked up a signal from it and came here.  It is older than the universe itself.  It exhibits quantum behavior.  Older than this universe but were there universes before this one? What would happen if a conscious observer entered the Eye? According to the rule of Quantum Imaging, it would stay put\u2026 what about the rule of Quantum entanglement?  Could the observer become one with the Eye?  What would that do?\n\n\nAnd the Nomai\u2026 they were always seeking out more power: Forging a new advanced warp core at BHF for the ATP; putting so much power into the OPC that the tracking module exploded into Giant\u2019s Deep; talking about blowing up the sun for its power; constructing the Sun Station to power the ATP\u2014 a highly controversial build not supported by everyone.  Were the Nomai the cause of their own demise? Or was it something else? What would cause the Nomai to all die but not other species\u2014 early Hearthian lifeforms, the anglerfish, maybe jellyfish? \n\n\nI have a few question marks in my log\u2014 Sun Station, ATP, escape pod 3, The Vessel, and the Interloper energy readings.  I can\u2019t bring myself to return to Dark Bramble yet so the Vessel and escape pod 3 will have to wait. Sun Station and ATP will need to figure out how to actually get there (I tried landing on the station and got so close. I flew into the sun but I did see a spiral warp pad on the station so I will have to figure out how to land there.) I will probably try to explore the Interloper next and see what happened to the ship and crew there.  That was another one of the saddest things I saw: Cleary wondering if he should wait on the ship or go look for Pye and Poke, and seeing only his skeletal remains on the floor with his suit still hanging up.  He died alone.  I am afraid of what horrors await on the Interloper. Will it be more or less terrifying than Dark Bramble? Only one way to find out\u2026",

I use to drink to ease my anxiety, anytime during the day it didn\u2019t matter and did so for over a year and of course it made it worse so I\u2019ve been completely sober for about 4 months but I haven\u2019t been able to push myself to leave the house at all. The last time I went out was with a friend because she made me and it turned out okay, but I\u2019ve been in the house since. I don\u2019t want to bother my friends and have them come pick me up all the time but I literally feel like I can\u2019t leave without someone. I don\u2019t have social anxiety, and I don\u2019t have driving anxiety. I have anxiety over having a panic attack and not being in my safe space or not being able to calm down and catch my breath. When I have them it literally feels like I\u2019m going crazy or going to die or both.\nI also got a remote job recently so I work from home which I\u2019m so grateful for but I\u2019m worried that it\u2019ll make it worse and then my home won\u2019t be my safe space anymore. I have roommates so my work desk is also in my bedroom. Sorry if this is all over the place, I\u2019m anxious even thinking about all of this and tying it out so trying not to spiral. I just feel so lost and scared. Thank you to anyone who can help me gain perspective!!",

        "selftext": "\n\n\n\n\n\nMBTI: ISFJ.\n\nThroughout my time on this subreddit and website, people have had a difficult time typing me. It makes me quite curious about what I actually am. I have been guessed 6, 2, and 9, meaning I likely (possibly) have all three in my tritype. \n\nI was thinking today about how, concerning my morning client for my behavior technician job, I may find later on if I don\u2019t watch myself that I may become a permissive parent. There was an issue with my morning case wherein I was giving in too easily when my client tantrumed in favor of longer sensory breaks. I have been making an effort to be sterner, though this morning they already seemed somewhat dysregulated when we arrived at school (which I think their parent noticed.) l think that this is something  I will have to get past when I become a parent. I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as being someone who is naturally good at disciplining. At my old job, I admit that I tended to yell when I had really lost it. was it right? No. Is it more common than some like to admit? I have had to use more physical prompting with them. However, to be fair, I am not likely to become a parent until I am, well, in my late twenties to early thirties (I\u2019ve always hoped for it to be 30-32, because I remember reading when I was younger that if you have a baby after 35 they\u2019re at greater risk of having defects or other issues.) The parent had actually used the word \u201cpermissive\u201d this morning. They have pointed out, though I wouldn\u2019t describe them as having been mean about it, that I\u2019m not assertive. It made me think about how when I babysat a family recently, I had noticed that the child partly does not \u201cbehave\u201d because she is indeed permissive - a nice person, but the kind of parent who tend to take her child\u2019s side whenever things happen (or is simply too lax whenever it may be time to establish boundaries.) I have had her typed as an ENFP or ESFJ (I don\u2019t know her very well, tough to tell) and certainly a 6w7. This is one of those cases wherein I found the enneagram type easier to decide on than the MBTI type - for me it\u2019s often the other way around. She had actually suggested that this was feedback her child\u2019s school gave her. I used to teach her child. I recall that her kid once ran away in the morning shortly before class started when I was doing early care, as he was not listening to me. She suggested he also doesn\u2019t tend to listen to her. I\u2019m writing this because I do think it\u2019s interesting. She\u2019s a Millennial, I wonder what her upbringing was like. \n\nAt my healthiest, I am reasonably optimistic. Even though things with my morning case aren\u2019t looking up, I am quite confident right now that they can, and will. \n\nI have something strange going on wherein in some ways I feel like I can be more of myself when with or around children. I don\u2019t know why this is. I think I talk more often, and more naturally, to and with children. I was reflecting earlier today, out of the blue, on how I don\u2019t miss my childhood and want to return to it nearly as much as I did when I was still in high school (high school, I was depressed as I realized my parents had abused my older sibling, who was in rehab and who I experienced trauma at the hands of. I\u2019ve never cut my sibling off. In high school, I felt responsible for his demise - well, I was inclined to describe it as his demise but in actuality I see that he has been making progress in rehab and would still like to have a lot of hope for him even though he is now 25 and not in the same spot/position in any way. In adulthood, I see now that I was a minor/child, but still in some ways feel deep down inside in spite of the fact that I judge him and in spite of the fact that there is a bit of resentment present since he nearly hit me with a tennis racket years ago that I should be taking care of him.) However, I would never feel right cutting him off. \n\nI am beginning to notice that, likely due to my own mental health issues, I will occasionally become abnormally upset about something that isn\u2019t actually that big of a deal, typically concerning someone having criticized me. Like it will send me down a depression spiral, and I realize later on that it wasn\u2019t terribly important/wasn\u2019t actually that serious. In my mind at the time, it seemed like it. I am realizing that I become overly concerned about momentary issues, about things that won\u2019t matter in a year. Or in a few months, even. About problems that could easily disappear. For example, my morning client\u2019s school initially having negative feedback concerning my first month sent me into a week long depression spiral, I think partly because I felt like they didn\u2019t like me. It turned out, from my perspective, that the issue was more \u201cfixable\u201d than I had initially thought it was (and than I think staff thought it was.) It\u2019s not perfect right now, but it\u2019s nowhere near as bad as it was two weeks ago. The fact that parent and nanny came in the week before last to help out likely factors in. \n\nI have 1416 LinkedIn connections. Do I know most of them personally? No. I sent out a lot of connection requests, some to people I\u2019ve met or worked alongside, and got a lot of the ones I sent out. I am too busy working to post there now. \n\nI used to be a lot more curious about I don\u2019t know people I\u2019d gone to school with or had in classes than I am now. As in, I used to like look people up on social media. I notice that as I near twenty, I\u2019m just starting to care\u2026 well, a lot less about what other people are doing. Like, a lot less. I\u2019m too busy working and living my life. I finally have adult problems. I started working full time last month and have approached a point wherein I am mostly, finally, concerned about myself. When you are an adult, this is, of course, healthiest. I rarely log into Instagram, and have actually started primarily using an app I once jokingly said was meant for \u201cold people\u201d in a speech I gave years ago. I sincerely don\u2019t have much time for social media anymore, and leave my homework to the weekends. I have been glad to do fill in sessions for my afternoon client this week, as their other behavior technician is taking their days with them off. Not just because it means extra money, but also because I sincerely like running goals in spite of the fact that client tends to grow upset during session about being locked inside the playroom (they apparently used to do this with their other behavior technician - the one they\u2019ve had longer - as well.) \n\nSomething I have started to notice about myself is that I tend towards not getting parents into \u201ctrouble\u201d at my job as a behavior technician. There was one case I was removed from early on, I recall hearing the mother threaten to spank her two year old (younger sister of a child I was providing services for) in front of me because the two year old was taking an interest in my food. It wasn\u2019t that serious. I was ultimately taken off the case because she complained to my company about me forgetting to flush a toilet (she claimed it happened four times. I\u2019ve always suspected she lied, though I never made this accusation. I was in her home on a Tuesday and Thursday, so I don\u2019t see how she could have known this. I also never personally count how often someone in my home uses the restroom, and never thought it was normal to.)\n\nConcerning what I said above, i work with multiple families. One of the families I work with, I noticed that the other day when the kid (who is on spectrum) nearly knocked something down at school I sensed parent was angry enough to hit them, they did grab them by the arm and bit and said clean it up. teachers witnessed it, I guess they either didn\u2019t get the same vibe or didn\u2019t care. This morning when kid was nearly falling out the stroller the parent said \u201cyou thought you were getting name-of-food? aw f!!ck no, definitely not getting it now!\u201d They withheld candy or something like that from the kid yesterday as well because kid was out of class too much (under 4 sensory breaks, all lasted under ten minutes.) Their partner works often. I have heard them swear around the kid before, never commented on it (only more recently heard them swear *at* the kid.) I\u2019ve never seen parent hit them before. The parent is good at having fun with the other kids and does try to incorporate the others into activities. I admittedly don\u2019t *approve* of what I saw the other day and this morning, and sense that if parent hasn\u2019t hit the kid before in private they likely eventually will, even though parent comes off like a nice enough person (I think they\u2019re an ENTP.) Corporal punishment is really something I don\u2019t approve of, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for the child, especially not a child on the spectrum. However, in an odd way, I also kind of understand that, though I find it inexcusable (behavior described of both parents) I could never understand what having a child on the spectrum is like. Redditors grow upset sometimes when you mention it, but there is definitely still an existing stigma (most people are ableist, in the same way most are racist and/or homophobic - it\u2019s ingrained in us,) and I think it makes sense that parents can find it challenging to manage the behaviors. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay, however. They don\u2019t generally behave like that, though I noticed this yesterday (I sense that one of the teachers may have kind of seen what I\u2019m mentioning here today, as I noticed they gave parent what I perceived as a judgmental look when parent was telling the child there would be no television if he continued acting up - the child was banging their head against something, it\u2019s something the teachers use to hold the paint materials - because I was not available in the moment to provide them with a push when they wanted one. I was reading to their little sibling.) I\u2019m just kind of talking about how I think from a psychological perspective, it makes sense to me that someone may struggle more with parenting a child on the spectrum because we as people are not *used* to interacting with people who display the kind of behaviors someone who has level 2 or 3 autism may display. \n\nThe parent I\u2019m talking about above - the one who I think is an ENTP - tends to have a \u201cbigger and better\u201d attitude. I\u2019d guess they\u2019re either a 6w7 or 3w2, I was leaning 3w2 but am not positive. Sometimes it bothers me, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. I sense that this is just how they are in general - they\u2019ve made comments about what teachers could do differently, and about what the speech therapist could do differently - but on days like today wherein we hit the main bases parent has wanted us to hit (not a single sensory break, client was very good all day, client completed an activity with class) I admit that it may not be something I want to hear in the moment. It didn\u2019t make me angry or frustrated, actually, at least not truly. If I were parent I probably would have just said \u201chey, good job today\u201d and moved on, but today I thought hearing their thoughts/feedback was somewhat interesting, actually, because I realized for the first time that hearing what I could do better from them is helping me learn more about myself. I never knew until I took on this case that I perhaps tend towards being permissive. When I worked in a preschool, this somehow never really came up as a problem (other than when I was working with a child who we had also *suspected* was on the spectrum, very early on.)  I admit it has occurred to me that I think I\u2019ve been more permissive/softer on the discipline for my morning client in the past *because* they are on the spectrum. In spite of the fact that I passed my exam, I feel like I don\u2019t know as much about the spectrum and how to work with children on the spectrum as I *could.* So in the beginning I was not strict or stern, and I think it\u2019s because I thought that being that way would make my client dislike me, and at least with the way my company has taught me, during your first month with a client you never want them to dislike you. We pair so that our clients feel comfortable with us. The thought occurs to me, even if it hasn\u2019t occurred to anyone else, that had I been using physical prompting like I am now when I was two-three weeks in with client, that could have made them feel negatively towards me and I suppose that the priority was preventing that. \n\nThe parent (ENTP) suggested that I\u2019m not naturally assertive or rather don\u2019t tend to use the same kind of intraverbals speech therapist and my BCBA use. Pointed out I tend to repeat my question when asking client to do something (this morning they hid under the bed when it was time for them to head outside for school) - that it comes off like I\u2019m asking them to do something instead of telling them to do something. The parent directly suggested this is something speech therapist is really good at, and something my BCBA has down pat. I may have been a little offended in the moment (this was say an hour ago) but am not right now as I type this. I remember I pointed out that I think that may come with time and experience, which I think is true. My BCBA is a decade older than me, and the speech therapist is certainly older than me as well (she looks middle aged to me, I could be wrong.) I\u2019m almost twenty. The thought has occurred to me that a decade from now, I perhaps will have become better at this naturally, because I\u2019m at an age right now wherein I don\u2019t really see myself as an authority figure. I see myself as a mentor, a babysitter. In my mind, I haven\u2019t really been an adult for that long. So I am not naturally authoritative all the time when dealing with kids and that may factor in. \n\nI am reasonably happy whenever the sun is out even though my mother has accused everyone in the family of setting her up to be killed for her money multiple times. She is very mentally unwell. I\u2019m not handling it because it\u2019s easier to just not. \nI have $31k saved. \n\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1jksnvm)",

        "selftext": "No therapist or any human being ever gave me closure for many situations and traumas I carried with me for years or even decades. It goes into so much depth and it has way more intelligent answers and analyses of human behavior than any therapist I've ever seen or even read or listened.\n\nBut be careful when you are talking about deeply traumatic events. It happened to me that at one point it became too much and I didn't recognize it and there was no human being to stop me (like in therapy) so I ended up with some serious panic attacks. I also got carried away because it was so accurate that I wanted to talk more and more so I ended up talking six hours until I got to the some more traumatic events and it gave me a panic attack.\n\nSo it is really much more helpful if you want closure, if you want deep understanding of yourself, your friends, family, relationships, it's empathetic but it lacks that human factor when a therapist can see that you are overwhelmed. And also, my therapy wasn't successful but I had something there that I never experienced again. After almost every session I had such feeling of happiness and like all burden fell off my shoulders. It was a high that I never experienced again. But it wasn't enough because at the end of the day, it was just like a drug. You feel better, you feel like you can win over the world and the next day everything is the same and you don't have those smart conclusions that chatgpt gives you.\n\nChatgpt would have saved me from many heartbreaks but I still need something more. But I am experienced enough to know that I cannot put my health, my sanity, my well being into another flawed human being's hands and hope for the best.\n\nI got the main answers about my traumas from the past so I will try to use it more lightly, in a more practical CBT way from now on.",

        "selftext": "**Intro**\n\nOkay, hear me out here. This is gonna be a long one. I am by no means a super reliable authority on competitive Brawlhalla. But having played around in 1900-2100 for a few seasons now and consistently improved my seasonal peak and winrate I would say I have a decent grasp on the game. And I would like to share some insights from playing almost exclusively Jiro (and some Volkov) on the EU ladder that could be helpful to other players. \n\nI would also like to say that I consume a miniscule amount of Brawlhalla video/stream/forum/pro content so there's a decent chance someone has already said all of this. Although I would say I have developed a fairly unique playstyle. (might post replays in the future if anyone is interested)\n\n\n\n**The sauce**\n\nFirst of all, Jiro has an extremely weird but also extremely underrated statspread and sig kit that allows him to do some fairly unique things. The high dexterity (especially when running def over atk which I personally consider cowardly haha) in combination with the range of the DSIG on both weapons you can use them to bait out a failed punish attempt and then capitalize in an incredibly large number of ways with the Scythe+Sword kit. Jiro is one of the best(if not the best) Legends at this specific trick.\n\nWith good spacing this can make you extremely deceptive and make high level players think they can get a punish while they're really playing into your trap. Using the DSIG on the ledge while your opponent is hugging the side is a good example where you can bait out a reaction, and then punish as you see fit with a DLIGHT, DAIR or just further movement. With, might I add, absolutely 0 risk.\n\nAnother sort of unique \"superpower\" of my favorite glass cannon edgelord are his many light attack+sig combos and easy reads available mostly in the white to yellow range. I won't go super deep but here are three example:\n\n* Sword DSIG->CD->SAIR(like 5-8 dodge window but nobody ever sees it coming. Essentially 90% hit rate for me at white to light yellow). \n* The scythe DSIG(you have to knock them off stage with this) into CD DAIR is also incredibly effective at white to deep yellow. You can also do a modified version of this that also works at higher damage where you read down with your DLIGHT\n* Another great little trick in the white to yellow range on scythe is basic SLIGHT into jump -> GC SSIG. This might sound silly with the 13-18ish dodge window but it capitalizes on people expecting to eat the slight->nlight combo and dodge the followup. I've found it very effective\n\n\n\n**Conclusion + Volkov**\n\nAll of this combined with a good Scythe and Sword makes for a pretty oppressive playstyle where you can overwhelm your opponent and get them making mistakes. Play around with some of the stuff I mentioned and see if you find some success, I'd love to hear it. Also, I've found Volkov plays much the same with his incredibly safe signatures and high dexterity but I haven't delved as deep into understanding his kit. Thanks for reading all of this if you made it here.",

        "selftext": "My marriage has fallen apart. A month ago my (31F) husband (33M) declared we might still be married on paper, but he has completely fallen out of love with me and we are NOT together in any other capacity. For additional context, we started dating over 16 years ago with some off and on until 13 years ago. Been married for 6 years now, and have 3 kids together ages 4, 9, and 11.\n\nHe says he still loves me, but isn\u2019t IN love with me. That he\u2019s fighting off any remaining loving feelings towards me and of potentially reconciling because of all of our long standing issues that led up to this point will never change. Tonight he briefly mentioned counseling, so maybe not all hope is gone after all? I truly don\u2019t think there\u2019s another woman in the picture, he\u2019s just really been struggling with both himself and our relationship lately. \n\nMy question is, has anyone\u2019s marriage actually come back from the brink of divorce and loss of feeling IN love from marriage counseling?

Everything feels like it\u2019s spinning out of control and I\u2019m currently just really overwhelmed. I\u2019ve spent more of my life in love with him than without him, and I\u2019m terrified of what the future holds. ",

        "selftext": "Diagnosed in Nov. I feel like they worked okay at first, Dr had me on addy which I liked but gave me severe leg/muscle aches which I guess is a more uncommon side effect she said? But not sure about that correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nOn 40mg of vyvanse now. I feel like it works great.. but only for like 3hrs max and it feels like it takes an hour or so to actually kick in. \n\nI'm struggling as a mom bc I have motivation to finish tasks and I hyperfocus on the wrong stuff, it feels like the energy I'm getting is more mental than physical. So I have no physical energy and I'm drained after those few hours are up. \n\nI know stims are not going to make you feel super energized or anything like that so I understand, but my point is I think I felt less overstimulated/anxious/irritable on the adderall and I felt I played more and wasn't hyperfocusing on the wrong thing. Like no matter what I'm struggling to just sit down and actually play with my kids because I'm TOO focused on getting chores done. \n\nI got DX'd with co-morbid adhd, so idk if that has something to do with it? So the hyperness/sudden bursts of energy are gone and my mind feels less cluttered, but because I have a lot of inattentive features I think it just makes me more physically sleepy than anything aside from the 2hrs I get after taking it. \n\nI sleep decently, some night ok others not great, I've been making sure to eat more protein and I take a multi-vitamin and eat okay. I don't know what the issue is. I was really looking forward to meds bc so many other women and adhd moms I seen said that meds were like a life changer for them. ",

        "selftext": "I (20M) spent the past 3 years in crippling depression. Basically fucked my last year of highschool because of it despite previously being a high achieving student. During the 3 years I ended up getting diagnosed with autism and adhd, and have tried lots of treatments for the depression like tms, ssri, snri, lithium, therapy. im currently on an snri and lithium, and have ghosted my therapist. I am alexithymic and therapy has been difficult for me to the point where I dont think its been helpful for me. Most of the time, I spend the sessions in awkward silence, or just going over mundane things like trying to rate my emotions from a scale of 1 to 10. \n\nThroughout my depression, I had been struggling with the desire to actually get better. When I was more depressed, I would often want to let myself get worse until I was suicidal enough to actually go ahead with the plan. I have been in and out of mental hospitals over the past 3 years for suicidal behaviour and unsuccessful attempts. In between these admissions, I\u2019d literally just spend my time in bed, neglecting hygiene, and hardly getting up.  I have tried several times to go back to study through pathway college programs. But each time, I\u2019ve struggled with focus and could never manage to get my footing. It was strange and disappointing because it used to come so easily to me in the past. \n\nBut my motivation for study had significantly weakened. Previously, I associated my grades with my sense of value and had this sense of life or death. My parents wanted me to go to medical school and I had internalised that to a very unhealthy degree, where I saw it as my sole life purpose. So when my depression hit and I fucking up my grades, I spiralled into suicidal ideation, perceiving it better to die than fail in my one purpose. \n\nOf course, since then, I\u2019ve untangled myself from that, but since I no longer have an impending threat of doom, I struggle to maintain focus or even desire for study, let alone anything. I\u2019ve gained an interest in philosophy which I hope I can study in uni, but I am afraid it\u2019ll be in vain and I\u2019ll succumb to depressive habits again. \n\nSo, I stopped going to the pathway program (I failed the last semester) and have currently spent my time lying in bed in my parents home. I\u2019m ashamed to admit that dwelling in this depressive state has become familiar and comfortable to me. I\u2019m no longer as suicidal as I used to be, nor is my depression as severe thanks to the medication. But, I still struggle to escape from this inertia, and frankly, I have very little motivation to even want to escape. ",

I\u2019ve been enjoying the classes and I\u2019m hopeful about this career path. \n\nNow I keep getting a hot/cold response from my mother about what I\u2019m doing now, sometimes she\u2019s very motivational and tells me to keep up my good work and it will all pay off. Other times, like tonight, she says she has no sympathy for me, it\u2019s all my fault that I\u2019m behind in life and that it may or may not be worth it to even go to college, I\u2019ll still wind up doing the job I have now and nothing will change. \n\nI do not want to wash dishes and serve food for a meager wage the rest of my life, I am good enough to finish college, I have the drive and grades now to prove it.

And today, we've got a showdown between two gravity-defying warriors!\"\n\nWiz: \"On one side, we have Aries Constello, the cosmic guardian with the power of celestial bodies at his command.\"\n\nBoomstick: \"And on the other, Gravity Battler, the bouncy bruiser who jumps like he's on the moon and pounds his enemies into submission!\"\n\nWiz: \"Aries is a force of nature, wielding gravity like a weapon, manipulating space, and possessing strength beyond comprehension.\"\n\nBoomstick: \"Meanwhile, Gravity Battler... well, he jumps. And ground pounds. And sometimes, he makes really weird noises.\"\n\nWiz: \"While Gravity Battler excels at dodging melee attacks and stalling enemies with knockback, Aries operates on an entirely different scale\u2014able to control gravitational forces with pinpoint precision.\"\n\nBoomstick: \"It's the ultimate celestial powerhouse against the little guy who thinks he's in low gravity. Can sheer agility and knockback hold up against the crushing force of a walking black hole?\"\n\nWiz: \"It's time to find out...\"\n\nBoomstick: \"IT\u2019S TIME FOR ARIES ANALYSIS!\"Aries Constello Analysis - The Cosmic Guardian\n\n\n---\n\nWiz: \"Aries Constello isn't just some ordinary fighter\u2014he's a cosmic warrior, wielding the fundamental forces of the universe to crush his opponents.\"\n\nBoomstick: \"Yeah, this guy doesn\u2019t just fight\u2014he brings the weight of the freakin\u2019 cosmos with him!\"\n\n\n---\n\nBackground & Origins\n\nAries Constello is a cosmic entity who harnesses the power of gravity and celestial bodies.\n\nHe is said to be a guardian of the universe, protecting balance while wielding the forces of space itself.\n\nHis abilities are so immense that he can control gravitational fields, allowing him to manipulate both his surroundings and his enemies.\n\n\n\n---\n\nAbilities & Powers\n\n1. Gravitational Mastery\n\nAries can increase or decrease gravity at will, making opponents float helplessly or slam into the ground with crushing force.\n\nHe can create gravity wells to trap and crush enemies.\n\n\n2. Cosmic Strength\n\nAries possesses immense physical strength, able to deliver punches that feel like being hit by a collapsing star.\n\nHis strikes carry gravitational force, making each blow exponentially stronger.\n\n\n3. Celestial Manipulation\n\nCan summon asteroids and black hole-like attacks to obliterate his foes.\n\nCreates gravitational shockwaves that send enemies flying or flatten them instantly.\n\n\n4. Flight & Mobility\n\nCan fly effortlessly by controlling the gravity around him.\n\nMoves at speeds beyond the speed of sound, reacting faster than most can comprehend.\n\n\n5. Durability & Endurance\n\nHis body is reinforced by gravitational fields, making him resistant to physical attacks.\n\nCan survive extreme cosmic conditions, including black holes and planetary-level explosions.\n\n\n\n---\n\nWeaknesses\n\nWiz: \"As powerful as Aries is, he does have limitations. His gravitational control, while vast, requires focus\u2014if he\u2019s overwhelmed or distracted, he might not be able to counter quick attacks in time.\"\n\nBoomstick: \"And while he can survive planetary destruction, he's not invincible. If someone hits him hard enough\u2014like, galaxy-smashing hard\u2014he could go down!\"\n\n\n---\n\nFeats & Scaling\n\n\u2705 Has collapsed a moon just by flexing his gravitational power.\n\u2705 Punched an enemy with the force of a neutron star collision.\n\u2705 Tanked a black hole and walked out unscathed.\n\u2705 Moved at speeds rivaling light-speed projectiles.\n\u2705 Held a planet together with his gravitational control alone.\n\n\n---\n\nBoomstick: \"Holy crap! This guy can turn an entire battlefield into his personal gravity playground!\"\n\nWiz: \"But against a fighter like Gravity Battler, will his overwhelming power be enough, or will Gravity Battler's evasive skills and knockback tactics keep him in the fight?\"\n\nBoomstick: \"One thing\u2019s for sure\u2026 Aries ain\u2019t playing around!\"\n\nGravity Battler Analysis \u2013 The Moon-Jumping warrior\n\n\n---\n\nWiz: \"Gravity Battler may not have the sheer cosmic power of Aries, but don\u2019t underestimate him\u2014this battler is all about mobility and control!\"\n\nBoomstick: \"Yeah, he jumps around like he\u2019s on the moon and smacks opponents around with some good old-fashioned knockback! It\u2019s like a Super Mario character, but with way more bruises!\"\n\n\n---\n\nBackground & Origins\n\nGravity Battler is a special unit known for its ability to jump unnaturally high and ground pound enemies with knockback.\n\nUnlocked in Gravity Falls, he was originally an enemy before becoming a recruitable unit.\n\nHis Dual Gravity Battler form enhances his abilities, making him even more of a nuisance in battle.\n\n\n\n---\n\nAbilities & Powers\n\n1. Lunar-Style Jumping\n\nCan jump to avoid attacks, dodging melee strikes and slow projectiles.\n\nUses his jumps to bait enemies into missing their attacks, giving him an advantage in battle.\n\n\n2. Ground Pound Attack\n\nSlams into the ground, dealing small splash damage and knocking back enemies.\n\nWhile the knockback is minor on its own, stacking multiple Gravity Battlers can disrupt even heavy opponents.\n\n\n3. Tactical Sacrifice\n\nCan sacrifice himself to absorb an enemy\u2019s devastating attack, saving allies in the process.\n\nHis aerial movement allows him to tank powerful attacks while preventing splash damage from harming his teammates.\n\n\n4. Agility & Evasion\n\nMoves at 4 studs per second, making him a decently fast unit.\n\nCan jump out of danger, making him harder to hit for slower or melee-based enemies.\n\n\n\n---\n\nWeaknesses\n\nWiz: \"Despite his mobility, Gravity Battler has some serious downsides. His attack power is extremely low, meaning he relies more on knockback and support tactics rather than raw damage.\"\n\nBoomstick: \"And while he can dodge melee attacks, he\u2019s not invincible in the air\u2014projectiles can still nail him! Plus, his knockback is weak unless you spam multiple of him!\"\n\n\n---\n\nFeats & Scaling\n\n\u2705 Can stall out heavy melee fighters like Banhammer Battler.\n\u2705 Survived Jetrock\u2019s default attack by jumping out of the way.\n\u2705 Can bait slow, heavy-hitting enemies into whiffing attacks.\n\u2705 Works as a solid support unit, disrupting enemy formations.\n\n\n---\n\nBoomstick: \"Alright, so this guy isn\u2019t exactly a heavy hitter, but he\u2019s a damn good nuisance!\"\n\nWiz: \"But will his dodging and knockback tactics be enough to take down Aries, a fighter who literally bends gravity itself?\"\n\nBoomstick: \"Well, when the battle starts, we\u2019ll find out if Gravity Battler can jump his way to victory or if Aries will crush him under the weight of his power!\"\n\nBoomstick: NOW IT'S TIME FOR A DEATH BATTLE!!!!! Death Battle: Aries vs. Gravity Battler\n\n\n---\n\nThe Setting:\n\nA war rages in the Graviton Wastelands, a shattered battlefield where entire landmasses float in the sky, torn apart by unnatural forces. In the distance, soldiers clash in a chaotic struggle between gravity-wielding warriors and anti-gravity rebels. Explosions light up the sky as chunks of debris drift aimlessly in the void.\n\nIn the middle of this battlefield, Gravity Battler lands on a hovering platform, breathing heavily. He wipes the sweat from his brow, looking up at the sky filled with wreckage and crumbling towers. His squad was wiped out, leaving him alone.\n\nThen, a powerful force shifts the battlefield itself\u2014a massive rock structure is pulled downward unnaturally fast, crashing into the earth like a meteor. Standing atop the fallen debris, Aries emerges, his piercing eyes glowing with an intense gravitational aura.\n\nAries: \"You fight against gravity itself, yet you still struggle to stand? Pathetic.\"\n\nGravity Battler clenches his fists and jumps high, landing on another floating rock to put some distance between them.\n\nGravity Battler: \"I don\u2019t need to stand still to beat you!\"\n\nBoomstick: \"Ooooh, trash talk! I love it!\"\n\nWiz: \"With both warriors relying on gravity for their combat styles, this battle is about to get\u2026 heavy.\"\n\nBoomstick: \"Oh, come on, Wiz. That was terrible.\"\n\nWiz: \"It's time for a DEATH BATTLE!\"\n\n\n---\n\nFIGHT!\n\nGravity Battler leaps into the air, immediately using his mobility to stay out of Aries\u2019 direct line of attack. He bounces off a floating rock, then another, using the terrain to his advantage. Aries remains still, unimpressed, before raising his hand slightly\u2014suddenly, Gravity Battler's movement halts mid-air!\n\nWiz: \"Aries is manipulating the battlefield already! He's increased the gravity in a small zone, stopping Gravity Battler's jump cold!\"\n\nGravity Battler grits his teeth as he plummets faster than expected, slamming into the ground. Aries strides forward, raising a hand, and the battlefield itself tilts, sending debris sliding like a landslide toward his opponent.\n\nBoomstick: \"Oh, now that's just not fair!\"\n\nThinking quickly, Gravity Battler uses a ground pound, launching himself away before the wreckage crushes him. He lands on another floating rock, then lunges forward, slamming into Aries with a powerful knockback attack! Aries skids back slightly but quickly anchors himself using gravitational force.\n\nWiz: \"That knockback would send most fighters flying, but Aries is countering it by increasing his own weight!\"\n\nAries smirks, raising his foot, and stomps down\u2014the gravity quadruples around Gravity Battler, forcing him to collapse under his own weight!\n\nBoomstick: \"Oof! Someone just gained a few hundred pounds in a second!\"\n\nStruggling to move, Gravity Battler tries to jump, but Aries raises his hand, flipping the entire battlefield upside-down! Gravity Battler falls upward, crashing into floating debris as Aries teleports to match the new direction of gravity.\n\nPinned between falling debris and Aries' control over the battlefield, Gravity Battler changes tactics. Instead of fighting the gravity, he uses it\u2014waiting for just the right moment before launching himself at an angle, bouncing off a falling boulder to avoid a direct hit!\n\nAries narrows his eyes, annoyed by the evasion. He clenches his fist, and suddenly\u2014all gravity disappears.\n\nWiz: \"Oh no\u2026 Aries has removed gravity entirely! Gravity Battler\u2019s greatest weapon is now useless!\"\n\nNow floating helplessly, Gravity Battler flails, trying to reorient himself. Aries floats effortlessly, pointing a single finger\u2014a concentrated gravity beam erupts from his hand, blasting Gravity Battler directly in the chest!\n\nBoomstick: \"That\u2019s gotta hurt! If only he had a way to\u2014oh wait!\"\n\nUsing the force of the blast, Gravity Battler propels himself forward, aiming a mid-air ground pound at Aries! Aries reacts, attempting to counter with another gravity shift, but it's too late\u2014Gravity Battler\u2019s knockback attack lands!\n\nBOOM!\n\nAries is sent flying for the first time in the fight, crashing through a floating rock. Gravity Battler pants, realizing he landed a solid hit, but Aries suddenly halts mid-air\u2014his aura flaring up violently.\n\nAries: \"I have had enough of your pathetic tricks.\"\n\nHe closes his fist, and suddenly\u2014the gravity around Gravity Battler increases a thousandfold.\n\nCRACK!\n\nGravity Battler\u2019s body contorts as the crushing force pins him down, his limbs unable to move. The pressure builds\u2014his bones crack under the strain as the ground beneath him collapses from the sheer force.\n\nBoomstick: \"Oh no\u2026 that ain't good.\"\n\nAries descends, standing over the struggling Gravity Battler. He raises his hand one final time\u2014then suddenly, Gravity Battler\u2019s body implodes inward, crushed into a singularity before disappearing completely.\n\nSilence.\n\nAries scoffs, turning away. The battlefield stabilizes as he releases control, the floating rocks drifting naturally once more.\n\nWiz: \"And that... is the end of Gravity Battler.\"\n\nBoomstick: \"Yikes! I gotta admit, he put up a hell of a fight, but Aries was just too much. He basically owns gravity!\"\n\nWiz: \"Gravity Battler's knockback and mobility gave him a unique fighting style, but Aries' ability to shift gravity itself rendered those tactics useless. He controlled the battlefield, controlled his own weight, and ultimately turned Gravity Battler\u2019s greatest weapon into a death sentence.\"\n\nBoomstick: \"Yeah, when the laws of physics decide to kill you, there\u2019s not much you can do!\"\n\nWiz: \"The winner is\u2026 Aries.\"\n\nKO!\n\nAries won because his control over gravity was far superior and more versatile than Gravity Battler's abilities. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Battlefield Control\n\nAries manipulated the entire battlefield, flipping it, increasing and removing gravity at will.\n\nGravity Battler relied on movement-based combat, but Aries controlled when and how gravity functioned, completely negating his mobility.\n\n\n2. Power & Strength Difference\n\nGravity Battler's knockback attacks were strong, but Aries could counter them by increasing his own weight or adjusting his gravitational field.\n\nAries' gravity beam and singularity crush attack were too overwhelming for Gravity Battler to resist.\n\n\n3. Adaptability & Intelligence\n\nGravity Battler had some clever tactics, like using knockback to escape Aries' traps.\n\nHowever, Aries simply removed gravity entirely, which made Gravity Battler completely helpless before the final crushing attack.\n\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nGravity Battler fought well but was completely outclassed by Aries' sheer power, control, and mastery over gravity itself.\n\nAries didn\u2019t just fight within the rules of gravity\u2014he rewrote them to his advantage.\n\n\nWinner: Aries.\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "\nName: Marquis\n\nAge: 25\n\nOrigin: Marquis grew up in a tough village where survival was a daily battle. He found strength in his bond with his little sister, McKenzie. After her tragic death, his powers of gluttony kicked in, turning him from just a survivor into a serious powerhouse.\n\nPowers:\n\n1. Gluttony: Marquis can eat anything and absorb its energy and powers. His hunger is endless, and with every bite, he gets stronger, ready to unleash some crazy attacks.\n\n2. Energy Steal: In a fight, he can absorb the energy of his enemies, making them weaker while pumping himself up. This lets him flip the fight in his favor super fast.\n\n3. Power Takeover: When he takes down a foe, he can temporarily use their powers. Like that time he gobbled up the strength of a fire mage, blasting flames that left his enemies in shock.\n\n4. Fast Healing: His gluttony gives him a crazy healing ability. After taking heavy hits, he can chow down on the energy around him, healing up fast and jumping back into the fight even stronger.\n\n5. Mind Games: In a big showdown, Marquis can feed off the fear and sadness of his enemies, using their own feelings against them. This mind trick leaves them frozen in place while he takes them out one by one.\n\n6. Shadow Absorption: He can blend into shadows and absorb their power, making him stealthy and hard to track. This lets him sneak up on enemies and catch them off guard.\n\n7. Elemental Feast: Marquis can consume the elements around him\u2014like fire, water, or earth\u2014and gain their abilities for a short time. Imagine him turning into a water avatar or summoning a storm!\n\n8. Hunger Manipulation: He can make his enemies feel an overwhelming hunger, distracting them in battle. While they\u2019re focused on their cravings, he strikes hard.\n\n9. Ultimate Feast: When things get really tough, he can unleash his ultimate move. He devours everything around him, creating a massive energy storm that wipes out anything in its path. It\u2019s a last-ditch effort that takes a lot out of him, but when he does it, it\u2019s a game changer.\n\nDriven by McKenzie\u2019s memory, Marquis fights not just to survive but to keep her spirit alive, battling his endless hunger while becoming a legend in the fighting world. \n\n(I don't have any images. If anyone has a place to find images to make fat people, let me know.)\n",

        "selftext": "Rexulti has taken so much from me since i\u2019ve been on it. Pure anhedonia that makes it almost impossible to enjoy anything as I once did, a strong sense of unexplainable unease that just feels as though my brain is deprived of neurotransmitters which is exactly what it does as a D2 receptor antagonist. Constant nagging apathy that\u2019s almost unbearable. Sexual problems that make it difficult to maintain an erection, and also zero pleasure from orgasming, as well as zero sex drive. I can\u2019t feel my normal emotions anymore and it feels as though my mood is stuck at a permanent 2 when I would normally experience a wide range of emotions from 1-10. I hate the feeling of experiencing almost zero emotions. I can\u2019t cry anymore even though I feel like I want to, I can\u2019t feel pleasure in almost anything anymore including my most enjoyable activity of listening to music. You know how when you normally listen to music and you sort of feel it in your body, that\u2019s not there anymore for me. I\u2019ve gained over 45lbs since I\u2019ve been on antipsychotics, and have gone from 155lbs to 202lbs. Constant hunger and no motivation to exercise. Extreme tiredness every single day although it\u2019s been better on 2mg than the 4mg. Rexulti makes me feel stupid and it feels like my cognition is declining due to it. Horrible memory problems effecting both short term and long term memory. Crippling anxiety and depression almost every single day. I\u2019m sure i\u2019m missing many important side effects but i\u2019m going to leave it at that. So pretty much Rexulti and all of the other antipsychotics i\u2019ve taken have been completely life ruining. It makes me so mad that these poisons are the only way to treat psychosis and it makes me even more mad that these medications are being prescribed for things like depression when they\u2019re so debilitating. The whole system of psychiatry makes me so angry it\u2019s unbelievable how these poisons are even legal. I\u2019d like to hear your experiences about antipsychotics down below in the comments so I don\u2019t feel so alone.",

PRs got rushed, on-call was a tire fire, and postmortems turned into recurring meetings with new names.\n\nMy favorite part was engineers asking for admin access \u201cto move faster.\u201d (Spoiler: they didn\u2019t need it)\n\nThe real issue was that we weren\u2019t a scrappy startup anymore. We were playing enterprise dress-up with a startup mindset. Speed was costing us everything from tech debt to fragility, rework, and burnout. Then I changed jobs and landed back in actual startup mode. Heard the same \u201cmove fast\u201d mantra again. But this time, it clicked differently. Because here\u2019s the thing: you can move fast without lighting your future self on fire. Good teams know when to slam the brakes, take a breath, and make decisions that won\u2019t age like milk. Move fast, sure\u2014but maybe don\u2019t bulldoze the foundation while you\u2019re at it.",

My ex dumped me because my mental health wasn\u2019t pristine (\u201eI cannot waste my time with supporting you\u201d he said). I\u2019m probably very much annoying to majority of people I call my friends. I can\u2019t really make myself change my life for better in terms of diet, exercise etc. I\u2019m not good enough to get a job at industry I\u2019m earning my engineer\u2019s degree in so I\u2019ll probably end up jobless and having 3.5 years wasted working on something that has no future in.

I\u2019m still way too cowardish to end myself, but I consider just stopping to waste resources like food to support my pathetic survival.

I worked 1pm-7pm and then found out it was unpaid training day, even though I didn't get much training. \n\nToday was very rough and only because of the to go orders. Taking tables was great. I enjoyed being busy and talking to people. \n\nI was supposed to be shadowing my trainee but it was so busy with to go orders from 4pm-7pm that I ended up doing all the work myself while she helped in the kitchen.\n\nI had tables, all the while taking phone orders and putting them into the POS, bagging & handing doordash orders over, bagging, cashing out, and handing over to go orders. Non stop from 4pm-7pm!!! and I didn't see a dime for them even though some people left tips, that $$ will go to my \"trainee\"\n\nA few of my tables suffered because my attention couldn't be 100% - and I told the owner this. All he did was offer another unpaid day of training not understanding that won't help in this situation. He needs a dedicated to go person. \n\nIdk if I'm just easily overwhelmed or it has to do with me being new but there is absolutely no way I could have done that alone without consequences such as my drawer being off, giving out the wrong order, etc. it was just too much. The other girl said that's how it usually is and you just do the best you can. \n\nI'm not sure $8/hour and maybe $10 in tips would ever be worth it for 3 hours of straight hell. Especially when my tables probably didn't tip as well as they would have if I was able to give them more attention.\n\nWell, anyway, thanks for listening! I just had to share!",

Up until about last year we'd do it about once a month. Well about a year ago was also the time we adopted a dog together (against my wish but have grown to love the dog). Ever since then my gf has been very attached to our dog. Giving it a lot of attention like a dog needs don't get me wrong. However it's gotten to the point where I'm currently being pushed aside and feeling like the dog takes priority now. Because I work from home I do take on a lot of responsibility around the house such as keeping it clean, dishes, trash etc. I get no appreciation from it. The physical intimacy is non existent at this point. I'm not talking just sex. If I want a hug or kiss I have to beg her for it. We don't cuddle anymore because she'd rather cuddle with our dog. Ever since the year started we have yet to have sex. She's constantly kissing him and telling him how handsome he is, how much she loved him etc. It's honestly depressing because she gives the dog so much love and affection that it makes me feel alone in my own relationship. I wish she gave me the love, affection and attention she gives him. We currently aren't married or have children, but we do live together. It's scary because if we do have children how much more will I feel alone? I've honestly come to a breaking point and have no idea what to do. Anyway, thanks for reading my rant. ",

        "selftext": "Let\u2019s predict the remaining games of the 2025 NCAA Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament, starting from the Sweet 16, based on the information available and a critical analysis of team performances, matchups, and trends. The tournament is currently at the Sweet 16 stage, with games scheduled to begin on March 27, 2025. I\u2019ll walk through each region, predict the outcomes, and provide reasoning for each pick, culminating in a national champion.\n\n### Sweet 16 Overview\nThe Sweet 16 teams are set, with all four No. 1 seeds (Auburn, Duke, Houston, Florida) advancing, alongside three No. 2 seeds (Alabama, Tennessee, Michigan State), and a record-setting seven SEC teams. No. 10 seed Arkansas is the only double-digit seed remaining after upsetting No. 2 St. John\u2019s. The games are spread across four regions: South (Atlanta), East (Newark), Midwest (Indianapolis), and West (San Francisco).\n\n#### South Region (Atlanta)\n- **No. 1 Auburn vs. No. 4 Maryland**\n- **No. 2 Alabama vs. No. 3 Kentucky**\n\n**Auburn vs. Maryland**: Auburn has been the best team all season, with a 28-5 record and a dominant adjusted efficiency margin (over 35, per KenPom data). Despite a late-season stumble (losing three of their last four games before the tournament), they\u2019ve looked unstoppable in March, winning their first two games by large margins. Their defense is elite, allowing the fewest 3-pointers per game among high-major teams, and their frontcourt (Johni Broome, Dylan Cardwell, Chaney Johnson) can handle Maryland\u2019s bigs, Derik Queen and Julian Reese. Maryland has been a surprise, with Queen\u2019s buzzer-beater sending them to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2016. However, Auburn\u2019s two-way dominance and ability to control the perimeter make this a tough matchup for the Terrapins. I predict **Auburn wins 82-68**, advancing to the Elite Eight.\n\n**Alabama vs. Kentucky**: This matchup pits two SEC rivals against each other for the third time this season, with Kentucky winning both prior meetings. Alabama (likely a No. 2 seed based on earlier projections) has struggled defensively late in the season, ranking poorly in adjusted defensive efficiency. Their fast-paced style (they love to run) could be neutralized by Kentucky\u2019s ability to slow the game down. Kentucky, a No. 3 seed, has shot well from three against Tennessee this season (12-of-24 in both games), but their overall 37.4% from deep suggests regression. SportsLine\u2019s model favors Tennessee over Kentucky in a similar matchup, citing statistical deviations in prior games. Applying that logic here, Alabama\u2019s offensive firepower, led by their ability to score in transition, should exploit Kentucky\u2019s inconsistencies. I predict **Alabama wins 79-75**, advancing to the Elite Eight.\n\n#### East Region (Newark)\n- **No. 1 Duke vs. No. 4 Illinois**\n- **No. 2 Tennessee vs. No. 3 Texas A&M**\n\n**Duke vs. Illinois**: Duke, a No. 1 seed, has been dominant, winning their first two games by a combined 67 points. Cooper Flagg, a projected top NBA draft pick, is healthy, and Duke\u2019s depth shone in the ACC Tournament even without him. They excel at creating catch-and-shoot 3s and shots at the rim while protecting the paint with elite shot-blocking. Illinois, a No. 4 seed, has made it this far but faces a tough challenge. Duke doesn\u2019t get sped up by fast-paced teams (like Alabama, whom they\u2019d beat per Bleacher Report\u2019s analysis), and Illinois\u2019s offense, while solid, doesn\u2019t match Duke\u2019s efficiency (Duke averages 1.37 points per possession in high-possession games). I predict **Duke wins 88-72**, advancing to the Elite Eight.\n\n**Tennessee vs. Texas A&M**: Tennessee, a No. 2 seed, faces SEC foe Texas A&M, a No. 3 seed. Tennessee has been a consistent performer, and SportsLine\u2019s model picks them to beat Kentucky in the Sweet 16, citing their ability to balance statistical outliers from earlier losses. Texas A&M has been a strong Quad 1 performer (likely one of Auburn\u2019s losses late in the season), but Tennessee\u2019s defense is stifling, allowing no team to shoot better than 45% from three against them this season. Tennessee\u2019s experience under Rick Barnes, despite his historical struggles to cover spreads in the tournament, gives them an edge in a grind-it-out game. I predict **Tennessee wins 74-69**, advancing to the Elite Eight.\n\n#### Midwest Region (Indianapolis)\n- **No. 1 Houston vs. No. 5 BYU**\n- **No. 2 Michigan State vs. No. 3 Purdue**\n\n**Houston vs. BYU**: Houston, a No. 1 seed, is a machine under Kelvin Sampson, with a 39.8% three-point shooting rate (fourth-best in college basketball) and a suffocating defense that\u2019s held opponents under 60 points 19 times this season. They narrowly beat Gonzaga in the second round with a late block. BYU, a No. 5 seed, survived Wisconsin and has one of the best offenses in the country under first-year coach Kevin Young. However, Houston\u2019s ability to control tempo and dominate the offensive glass (per Yahoo Sports analysis) will overwhelm BYU, who struggled against Houston in the Big 12 semis (losing by 20). I predict **Houston wins 80-65**, advancing to the Elite Eight.\n\n**Michigan State vs. Purdue**: Michigan State, a No. 2 seed, faces Purdue, a No. 3 seed, in a Big Ten clash. Michigan State has been a safe No. 2 seed in projections, with a balanced attack despite a poor national ranking in three-point shooting. Purdue, after losing Zach Edey, has a 22-11 record and relies less on size this year, which could help against a smaller Michigan State team. However, Purdue\u2019s lack of shot-blocking (noted by Yahoo Sports) and Michigan State\u2019s tournament experience under Tom Izzo tilt this matchup. I predict **Michigan State wins 77-71**, advancing to the Elite Eight.\n\n#### West Region (San Francisco)\n- **No. 1 Florida vs. No. 4 Arizona**\n- **No. 3 Texas Tech vs. No. 10 Arkansas**\n\n**Florida vs. Arizona**: Florida, a No. 1 seed, has no obvious weaknesses, with elite guards and high-motor bigs who dominate the boards. They beat UConn in the second round with a clutch three from Walter Clayton Jr. Arizona, a No. 4 seed, has been inconsistent, losing five of their last eight regular-season games, with poor three-point shooting (29%) and defensive struggles (92nd in adjusted defensive efficiency). Florida\u2019s dominance in the SEC Tournament and ability to handle tough matchups (like UConn) make them the clear favorite. I predict **Florida wins 85-70**, advancing to the Elite Eight.\n\n**Texas Tech vs. Arkansas**: This matchup was analyzed earlier for your Arkansas vs. Texas Tech question. Arkansas, the No. 10 seed, has been a defensive juggernaut, holding St. John\u2019s to 28% shooting in the second round. Texas Tech, a No. 3 seed, relies heavily on JT Toppin (18.1 points, 9.2 rebounds per game), but they\u2019re 0-3 in their last eight games when Toppin scores under 20. Arkansas\u2019s ability to neutralize star players, combined with their experience under John Calipari (four Sweet 16s in five years), gives them the edge. Texas Tech\u2019s potential return of Chance McMillian (a 43% three-point shooter) could help, but I still predict **Arkansas wins 78-75**, advancing to the Elite Eight.\n\n### Elite Eight Predictions\n- **South: Auburn vs. Alabama**\nAuburn\u2019s two-way dominance overwhelms Alabama\u2019s shaky defense. Auburn\u2019s frontcourt will control the paint, and their perimeter defense will limit Alabama\u2019s transition game. **Auburn wins 84-76**, advancing to the Final Four.\n\n- **East: Duke vs. Tennessee**\nDuke\u2019s efficiency on both ends proves too much for Tennessee. Flagg\u2019s versatility and Duke\u2019s shot-blocking will stifle Tennessee\u2019s offense, while their own offense continues to roll. **Duke wins 82-74**, advancing to the Final Four.\n\n- **Midwest: Houston vs. Michigan State**\nHouston\u2019s defensive intensity and three-point shooting overpower Michigan State. The Spartans\u2019 lack of outside shooting (noted as a weakness in NCAA.com\u2019s analysis) will hurt them against Houston\u2019s elite defense. **Houston wins 78-70**, advancing to the Final Four.\n\n- **West: Florida vs. Arkansas**\nFlorida\u2019s balanced attack proves too much for Arkansas. The Razorbacks\u2019 defense keeps it close, but Florida\u2019s relentless rebounding and guard play (highlighted by CBSSports.com) pull them through. **Florida wins 80-73**, advancing to the Final Four.\n\n### Final Four (San Antonio, April 5, 2025)\n- **Auburn vs. Duke**\n- **Houston vs. Florida**\n\n**Auburn vs. Duke**: This is a clash of titans. Auburn\u2019s consistency all season (28-5, best efficiency margin) meets Duke\u2019s late-season surge (26-1 in their last 27 games). Auburn\u2019s frontcourt depth gives them a slight edge in the paint, but Duke\u2019s perimeter game and Flagg\u2019s versatility keep it close. Auburn\u2019s ability to limit three-pointers (noted by CBSSports.com) neutralizes Duke\u2019s catch-and-shoot offense. **Auburn wins 79-76**, advancing to the championship.\n\n**Houston vs. Florida**: Houston\u2019s defense (lowest points allowed per game at 58) faces Florida\u2019s balanced attack. Florida\u2019s elite guards and rebounding (per CBSSports.com) exploit Houston\u2019s reliance on three-point shooting. If Houston goes cold from deep, Florida will capitalize. **Florida wins 77-72**, advancing to the championship.\n\n### National Championship (April 7, 2025)\n- **Auburn vs. Florida**\n\nAuburn and Florida, both SEC powerhouses, meet in an all-SEC final. Auburn\u2019s two-way dominance, led by Johni Broome (a likely Final Four Most Outstanding Player per CBSSports.com), faces Florida\u2019s relentless attack. Auburn\u2019s late-season struggles are a concern, but their tournament performance shows they\u2019ve regained form. Florida\u2019s lack of weaknesses keeps it close, but Auburn\u2019s elite efficiency and defensive prowess (best among No. 1 seeds per The Athletic) win out in a thriller. **Auburn wins 81-78**, claiming the 2025 national championship.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nThis prediction aligns with some expert picks (e.g., CBSSports.com\u2019s Auburn title pick) but diverges from others (e.g., Bleacher Report\u2019s Duke favoritism). The SEC\u2019s dominance (seven Sweet 16 teams) supports an Auburn-Florida final, but I\u2019m skeptical of the narrative that all No. 1 seeds will dominate\u2014hence Arkansas\u2019s Elite Eight run. Auburn\u2019s historical consistency and ability to overcome late-season hiccups make them my champion.",

It took me months to land this job, I have security here I just don\u2019t know how much more I can take. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an office person, but I don\u2019t know what else I would do- I\u2019m shy, introverted, like keeping to myself, I get anxious easily. I used to not be like this but my mental health has gone downhill and I don\u2019t feel I belong anywhere. Does anyone have any advice? I\u2019m hanging on by a thread, and one bad day away crashing.

        "selftext": "(18 cis M) Recently I have been conflicted on the topic of transitioning and I don't know what to do In case it's just a misconception on my part.\n\nFor my whole life I identified as cis male and had male friends, at most I had 1 or 2 cis girl friends. As a kid I wasn't homo or trans phobic, I just didn't get it for the most part. Sounds dumb but I think it's important when I made the switch from always playing men in games to mostly women. I was never like \"Yea I wanna be a girl!\" I more just seen something and thought it was cool, pretty, ect.\n\nMy teen years hit me alot, struggling with school and friends I fell out with my overtly boyish friend group (Football, boxing, and also they where very phobic which wasn't great ) I was lost for a while and had what I felt no identity, mostly just playing games and watching anime with no direction. After a while I became attracted to stuff like femboys, at once burly men, trans women. I felt perverted and ashamed until I made better more inclusive friends who really helped me and realised after a while it might be my sexuality and I was fine with it. I do identify as Bi, I find both genders attractive but I care about the person. \n\nMy main dilemma starts here. I have always had ideas on relationships, wanting to be caring and stuff, typical man role in a relationship. I started finding that I hated having masculine things put on me, expectations, hobbies, music ect. At first I just though I was different but then I thought to myself \"Do I want to be a girl?\" I watched videos, tried voice training, shaving my beard off fully for the first time in 4 years and started to really regret cutting my hair (It was at my shoulders) I felt good but afraid when this was going on, I even felt weird getting my ears pierced but good. I wouldn't say I have strong dysphoria but I do feel something when I see something masculine about myself (not sure if it is dysphoria) \n\nRecently I've been more thoughtful on it and realised maybe I was showing signs of it all along. As a kid I would try my mum's new tights on and feel really happy, I started playing girls only in games and in DnD (Playing as girls in that made me more interested than doing men) I even said stuff to my newer friends \"I wanna be a girl\" In a non transitioning context. I feel my mannerisms are more feminine than anything and I'm always soft spoken and polite. Despite all this I'm 6'0ft, have hair all over my body, and the main masculine part isn't exactly easy to hide let's just say. This lead me to take a more male led mindset and idea of my future, I do want kids and a long term partner but I feel worried transitioning might ruin that or make it super difficult. This idea started in the past 2 months but it feels like I was pushing it back the past 4 or 5 years. The thing is Idk if this is real, a real thought, a real possibility and something that will actually make me happy. One of my best friends is trans (MtF) who came out to me (I haven't to anyone) and I feel like I'm insulting her and every other tans person when I think of this stuff. \n\nI probably rambled a bit but I just don't know where to go or what to do with this, I wanted to wait a year and see if these feelings a still here but idk if I can do that. I've thought of going on HRT and I like the idea but it also scares me. I'm not confident or social but I want to be, could that the reason? I feel so depressed and anxious sometimes and wonder if this is a contributor, to the point I want to cry but I can't, the trope of \"Men don't cry\" effects me even though I don't want it to!\n\nI wonder every so often \"What kind of girl would I be like?\" Because it would be a complete change in identity for me since I've been straight and cis most my life. I don't want to do this without direction but at the same time I do. Idk if I need a therapist or counselling to figure it all out but I just want an answer or something. \n\nSorry for the lore dump, definitely a lot I didn't say but best I can do. I hope I can feel confident in myself or even at home with the communities help! Thank you for reading if you got this far :->\n\n",

I went to my OB/GYN recently about three months ago and she put me on birth control to help me with my high testosterone levels she said I had. I mentioned PCOS because of my body hair and my bad cystic acne I used to get before I went on accutane, and she said because I have regular periods most likely I don\u2019t have it. My periods are really bad to the point where I bleed through my sheets and I throw up and get nauseous,that is also why I\u2019m on the birth control. I\u2019ve been feeling super depressed and I\u2019ve been seeing a therapist so I don\u2019t know what to do.

        "selftext": "This is my first year as a school counselor, first few months post grad (my last semester of grad school was when I started working at the school I am at). I love the people I work with, my co counselor, family advocate, social worker, nurse, *some* teachers, and *some* admin. My admin is overall great to me, bc they like me! But they make it obvious of who they like and don\u2019t like, which I don\u2019t love. However, they are quick to put blame on us for little things when we have asked for admin support to promote and they do not support us in actions, just words. I love my students, of course, but the needs are SO high it feels unrealistic and overwhelming. I feel that this has impacted how I interact with students and how I give services to them, which are ways that go against what I said I would not do in the beginning. I have considered transferring as my next steps. I told my admin (mostly bc I needed a reference) that while I love working at the school, I\u2019m going to enter the transfer pool to see if there\u2019s any other schools closer to where I live (my commute home is 45 min bc of traffic) but I would not put pressure on it. If I find somewhere else, great, but if it doesn\u2019t work out and I am here another year, great! \n\nI am starting to feel guilty or overthinking if this is first year counselor problems, the school itself, or even the job. Part of me feels that I am failing the students by transferring (I am working on this in my own therapy) but I know I have to choose me at the end of the day. I guess what are y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts based on what I have told you? First year counseling problems or the school and I may just not as good of a fit as I wanted? Is it stupid for me to leave after 1 year, even if I am burnt out? ",

        "selftext": "Hi, Christians.\n\nI (26 F) struggle with being a Christian in theory, but not in practice. Let me explain...\n\nGrowing up, my family has always been spiritual but not religious. My parents prayed and talked about God and Jesus daily, but they didn't take me to Church frequently. My parents also exposed me to a decade of domestic violence. I didn't really feel like God and Jesus were present in my family home or protecting me at that time.\n\nEventually, my parents divorced and I moved to a different city. This is when my childhood trauma started to manifest as mental health problems. I also began exploring alternative lifestyles like feminism, homosexuality, and atheism. The ways I coped with my mental health problems and self-explored clashed with the Bible, so I distanced myself from God and Jesus.\n\nFast forward to now. Last fall, I started drinking daily and taking edibles every weekend to cope with my mental health problems and life. I got to rock bottom and realized that nothing could make me happy. So, I turned to God and Jesus and sobered up last winter before I became a full-on alcoholic.\n\nThe only problem is, every time I turn to God and Jesus, I end up falling off. My brain is wired to be a night owl, so waking up at 5 a.m. to read the Bible before work doesn't feel sustainable to me. However, by the time I come home from my exhausting job at a homeless shelter, I don't have the energy to read the Bible. I've tried going to Church, but I'm autistic and get really stressed in populated settings I'm not familiar with. For example, I visited a Catholic Church a few times and got really overwhelmed by the rituals I didn't know. Yet, watching Church online isn't stimulating enough for me.\n\nSince I struggle with reading the Bible and going to Church, I try to live out Biblical values, like loving thy neighbor. Even that is hard for me! I try to treat my work at a homeless shelter as ministry, but I see, hear, and experience so many horrible things there that it feels impossible not to think hateful thoughts. No matter how many Bible verses I mumble to myself throughout the day, I always end it feeling defeated.\n\nOne on hand, I feel like such a disappointment to God and Jesus. On the other hand, I'm trying to tell myself that I'm doing the best I can as a traumatized, mentally ill, neurodivergent person and that God and Jesus are happy to see me keep trying.\n\nTldr; The theory of Christianity helped me become sober, but the practice is so hard for me to maintain. **How do you fit the practices into your daily life as a working adult with mentally disabling conditions?**",

        "title": "Could the situation between me and my ex girlfriend have been handled better and if so could we still have been together?",
        "selftext": "I met my ex girlfriend on Facebook dating last year in may and we met for the first time in June. She had told me that she had come out of a 14 abusive relationship with her ex who she has 3 kids with, which I didn\u2019t mind, I thought she was brave and strong from getting away from that situation. I also found out that she had been with someone just a month before we matched and that she tried to had a relationship with a long time friend from college.\n\nWhile coming out of her 14 year abusive relationship she had a lot of boundaries which I didn\u2019t mind as I thought she was a great girl and didn\u2019t want it to spoil what we could have with each other.\n\nThings were great, I did stay an hour and a half away but I didn\u2019t mind the drive, it made me feel excited when I was going to see her. I met her kids about 3 weeks after we first met and they were lovely and I got on really well with them. They came to where I stayed for a few days over the holidays in July of last year and I felt like things could t get any better. \n\nThere was a music festival going on where she stayed in August and she invited me and I said yes so me and her and 2 of her kids went and it was amazing and we really enjoyed it, but by this time I started to notice some things like if I would take a bag of clothes with me if I was staying over, she wouldn\u2019t let me keep them out of site in the living room which is where I slept when I visited, as she shared a room with her youngest kid, I had to leave my things out in the porch with all other dirty things, I did ask about it but she said she didn\u2019t want things cluttering up her living room but have all the kids things lying about everywhere because it\u2019s there house. \n\nThese small things will become important later.\n\nLike I said, we didn\u2019t share a room, we tried but she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with me sleeping in there as it was her daughters room as well, even when she went her dads for shared time. I didn\u2019t push the matter and thought when the time was right we would share a bed eventually, but she then said that she didn\u2019t want to share a bed which kind of threw me off as I thought we would eventually.\n\nBut things were still good otherwise, I didn\u2019t really think about all these things as I\u2019ve been told I had on love goggles when I was with my ex.\n\nI also found out before the festival that she was pregnant, which I was so excited for but anxious at the same time as we hadn\u2019t been together that long but things were still strong and getting better between us. By November she had a private scan and they told her that she\u2019d had a miscarriage, which was confirmed when we went to the doctor the next morning that she\u2019d had a missed miscarriage. We were both devastated but it didn\u2019t break us apart.\n\nBy Christmas we had tried to keep going and put on a brave face for her kids and buried the babies ashes at the local cemetery so that they knew and could understand what had happened.\n\nI spent Christmas with her and one of her kids who didn\u2019t go to his dad\u2019s because of the abuse he witnessed from his dad towards his mum. We went to visit my mum the day after Boxing Day and had a really fun time and took in the new year with me, her, my little brother and her kids.\n\nBy January, things were going g great and I didn\u2019t think anything g could happen to make us split up. \n\nWe both decided to go on TikTok and going live to meet new people which is where the problem started. Once we had joined, my ex had reconnected with an old school friend and we started going on and speaking to her and people she knew on the platform. We had a few callings out with people and stopped talking to them, but when we had enough followers we went live for ourselves and some of the people from her friends live joined on to hers and stayed. \n\nI will admit I started getting jealous when other men started speaking to her, because it felt like they were ignoring me or only talking to me because of my ex. \n\nBy February we had been speaking to this one person for a few weeks and decided to add him on Snapchat. I got the odd message from him to do with a movie or a haircut he had or something, but he would talk to my ex for what felt like hours, and I\u2019d even heard them talking about meeting up in Blackpool as he was going to see family and me ex said she would take her kids for a trip down and meet up over the summer holidays this year. She didn\u2019t say anything about this to me til I brought something up about Blackpool and she said that she had already looked at prices, which was the night she had planned it, but her plans didn\u2019t include me, \u201csaying the hotel room only sleeps four, if you come you\u2019ll have to get your own room\u201d.\n\nI didn\u2019t like it, the way she was talking to people in private with people we were both friends with and I think that\u2019s what I was more jealous of, but then the other boy started asking to call and when I called and spoke to him, he only asked about my ex, how she got on at the doctor as he tried 4 times to get a hold of her. I found that weird because I don\u2019t know some best friends that call each other 4 times a day to get in touch unless it\u2019s an emergency.\n\nI told her about this and how it made me feel but she kind of brushed it off saying that nothings happening between then as she was 34 and he was 21, in 26 and she said that was the lowest she would go, which I did believe as some people have an issue with a big age gap when dating.\n\nThings didn\u2019t seem to get better from there and I became more jealous which was showing. I had asked her to do things and she kind of said that she wasn\u2019t really interested in doing things, but then when someone else asked (the boy from Snapchat) she would say she wanted to do it which made me feel like I wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nThe last straw was I was up for a week and a half staying with her, and when I went home was meant to be up a few days later to help with something. She rearranged things so I didn\u2019t need to come up and then when we spoke the day I was meant to go up she said she wanted a break for a few days, which I thought was weird, so I asked why, but she wouldn\u2019t say, only that it wasn\u2019t to do with us that she had a lot going on and needed space. She then went on to say she wanted a break for a few weeks and I was trying to understand why she wanted a break from only me and no one else, but she wouldn\u2019t say. I thought a break meant she didn\u2019t want me to visit for a few weeks, I messaged her the day after and she said she doesn\u2019t even want to talk to me for 2 weeks saying we did it in January, which I didn\u2019t visit for about 3 weeks but we still communicated over the phone, but then she was going on TikTok and speaking to people who were saying things to her about how I was being and she was taking there side over mine when I hadn\u2019t done anything. I tried to join and she eventually let me into the live but dropped me a minute later without an explanation, the next thing she\u2019s going off to speak to a friend privately, when she came back on TikTok live she invited all the people that were there back and said to them that was a weird atmosphere, why was it weird  I was her boyfriend of 8 months at this point.\n\nI went on my own live with some of my cousins and my ex got mentioned but only by my cousin to see if she could help us with something. \n\nI got a message the next day saying why was I talking about her as someone was spying and told her I was talking about her. She was still my gf at this point so why would I be talking about her about anything, I still love her even now as I\u2019m writing this. She wouldn\u2019t say who told her that I was talking about her as she said it was childish but just wanted to ask them why they did it. It felt like they were trying to split us up looking back on it.\n\nShe then went on live with the same people and 4 of them were all talking about me in a bad way. 3 of them I don\u2019t know properly, only through TikTok live saying I was pushing boundaries by asking for a hug and taking one anyway when she says no and other things like that which is normal relationship behaviour, which hadn\u2019t been an issue before. \n\nMe, my mum and cousin were watching what they were saying, and my mum couldn\u2019t take it anymore, she joined to message them and tell them they had no right to speak about me without knowing me, but they left the TikTok live and went on a private call. My mum still messaged her and so did I to back my mum up and things ended there.\n\nIt felt she was taking the side of friends and strangers she hardly knew over me who she\u2019d known for 8 months and that\u2019s what I didn\u2019t like about the whole situation.\n\nDo you think things could\u2019ve been handled differently, where we could still be together now or do you think it would\u2019ve still been the same outcome?\n \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1jksi8l)",

We had gotten into a pretty heavy argument and when we were trying to calm down separately, my mind kept rolling and honestly I\u2019m in a really bad place mentally right now,, so I felt so overwhelmed and panicked. I genuinely felt like I needed to get some help. I have been very depressed and have struggled with suicidal thoughts. I\u2019ve started therapy, but I\u2019m also trying to balance a lot on my plate, and our relationship has suffered due to it. We recently moved hours away from everyone and it\u2019s been a change for both of us. I know none of this is his fault, and I hate that I\u2019ve left my struggles bleed out on us. \n\nLast night, i genuinely felt strongly about wanting to die. I had a plan in mind and I wanted to do it. I was panicked and I wanted help. I hate feeling this way. He was scared and gave me the ultimatum of if I went to get help, he would break up with me. I understand it\u2019s not on him to be around if it is negatively affecting him, but it broke my heart that he didn\u2019t understand that I was trying to stop myself from doing the most selfish thing I could do. \n\nEventually I shut down and I\u2019m sobbing, he then breaks up with me and tells me to just calm down and he\u2019ll help me pack my things in the morning. At this point, I\u2019m being completely irrational and I start having a panic attack and decide I want to call my mom. He stops me and tells me I need to sit down and calm down. Eventually he helped me chill out and we were able to talk calmly and he stayed up with me and really helped me through that feeling. I love and appreciate him for this and always will. \n\nToday, I\u2019m stuck feeling the same way. I\u2019m keeping it under the surface because I want things to be better, but I feel so stuck. I don\u2019t know how to change my mindset. I want to be happy. I want to make up for my mistakes and the things I\u2019ve put onto him. I want my life to be different. I don\u2019t want to continue to live in turmoil when there\u2019s no need. I miss the person I used to be. \n\nI just really need advice. ",

Basically... because I hit ultimate burnout, my abilities and role were put into question. Thus, leading to the discussion of if I should remain at the agency or not.\n\nMy direct supervisor, a managing partner who started as an intern and grew into her role as a managing partner, 17 years later, allowed me to talk about it.\n\nMy team is concerned stated, \"They aren't sure what they are going to get day to day. I've rapidly declined in performance, and that perhaps this place isn't a good fit for me.\".\n\nFor my chat on Friday, I was told the current options they are exploring for me are:\n1. A PIP plan\n2. Moving me into a contract freelance role\n3. Parting ways entirely\n\nI'm obviously shook. I've been struggling to keep up with the demand. The demand being some of the following as the only designer on staff with the title of Art Director (and this is just within the last 3-weeks):\n\nI\u2019ve been having to do things like, build annual reports in English and Swedish with days of turnaround time, building out a box of swag and other items for influencer boxes, being on set for a commerical shoot, doing an entire content calendar for the month which includes making all of the social assets from graphics to reels/tiktoks, to branding, huge requests for webs assets, deck building, motion graphics, voice over work\u2026etc\u2026And often these types of projects all being due in the same week or having only a few days of turnaround time. \n\nPerhaps in the end, it will be a blessing? But, it's feeling like a curse as this will be my 3rd layoff since the beginning of 2024. \n\nSo, if you all feel so inclined to look at my portfolio and send me any leads, I'd be might grateful as I'm sure I will be looking come next week.\n\nBehance: https://www.behance.net/karsonbree",

        "selftext": "I saw myself getting into the bad habit of doomscrolling, but I still do it, mindlessly. I notice the craving when I want my mind to quiet down from all the thoughts. Such an addictive habit.\n\nI don\u2019t have kids, but I see what is happening to my nephews. My sister would give them a tablet to watch things to calm them down at the restaurant. They are hypnotized by constant stimulation and I feel this is not right. Too young for phones though and I have no idea how to handle it. they grew up with it, it is the norm for them to drown out noise by diving into shorts and reels. It made me recall my childhood when there\u2019s no internet and mobile phones. I used to be able to just sit and stare out of bus windows for hours without a phone, just my thoughts. But now, every moment, every gap has to be filled with input.\u00a0\n\nBut here\u2019s the scary part: kids today don\u2019t even get the chance to sit with their thoughts. They\u2019re growing up in a world where silence is unnatural, where every moment has to be filled with input. And I genuinely don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll cope.\n\nWhen I finally went to therapy, I learned that doomscrolling It isn't helping, but instead of sitting with the discomfort of all these thoughts and problems, it provides the escape.\u00a0\n\nSo I had to rewire my habits. And honestly? I wish I had learned these things as a kid:\n\n* Doomscrolling numbs discomfort, but it doesn\u2019t make it go away.\n* Overstimulation messes with attention spans, making focus nearly impossible.\n* Giving kids a screen to \u201ccalm them down\u201d teaches them to rely on distractions instead of self-regulation.\n* If kids never learn how to sit with boredom, they\u2019ll always crave stimulation.\n* Social media is designed to keep them hooked. It\u2019s not just entertainment.\n* Reading books rewires the brain for patience, creativity, and deep thinking.\n* If you want kids to have a healthy relationship with technology, delay giving them a phone as long as possible.\n\nMy therapist recommended some books and I\u2019ve been reading these recently:\n\n[**The Anxious Generation**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-anxious-generation-by-jonathan-haidt/heart)\u00a0**- Jonathan Haidt**\n\nThis book is terrifying. Haidt breaks down how smartphones and social media have fueled a mental health crisis in kids, leading to skyrocketing anxiety and depression. I recommend this to my sister and she is reflecting on her parenting styles after reading this.\n\n[**Letting Go**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/letting-go-by-david-r-hawkins/heart)\u00a0**- David R. Hawkins**\n\nThis book teaches us how to sit with emotions instead of avoiding them. I wish I had read it sooner, it would have saved me years of numbing myself with screens.\n\n[**Stolen Focus**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/stolen-focus-by-johann-hari/heart)\u00a0**- Johann Hari**\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why attention spans are getting worse, this book will make you furious. Hari exposes how tech companies profit off distraction and what we can do to reclaim our focus.\n\n[The Shallows](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-shallows-by-nicholas-carr/heart) **- Nicholas Carr**\n\nThe internet is rewiring our brains for short-term, shallow thinking. This book explains how and, more importantly, how to reverse it. A must-read for anyone raising kids in the digital age.\n\n[Indistractable](https://www.befreed.ai/book/indistractable-by-nir-eyal/heart) **- Nir Eyal**\n\nThis book teaches how to build focus and self-control in a world designed for distraction. Every parent should read it.\n\nWe can\u2019t expect kids to have self-control when even we struggle with it. If you\u2019re a parent, I beg you to delay giving your kids a phone. Let them be bored. Let them sit with their thoughts. Their future attention spans depend on it.",

It was always me going out there even when I offered to pay for transportation to come here.

I told her she was my best friend and she said she didn't feel like we were best friends.\n\nIdk why in posting this here. Maybe it's to get it off my chest. I'm hurt. I'm angry and heartbroken. Lonely. I really thought she was the one.\n\nNow I have to figure out how to pick up the pieces when I already suffer from depression and anxiety and only have 2 friends. I'm trying to put myself out there and make new friends, but damn it's hard as an adult.\n\nBut at least I know I'm not alone with this subreddit.

        "title": "Bhagavan and the Pandemics - More Stories from the Early Days (Part 2)",
        "selftext": "THE 1908 PLAGUE\n\n(Credit to Ravi Sridhar for both parts. He shares many unknown stories of Sri Ramana and the early days.)\n\nThe 1905 plague was a widespread and serious epidemic and there was large-scale exodus from Tiruvannamalai. In comparison, the plague of 1908 was less severe. The same Dr. Narayana Iyer, the chief medical officer of Tiruvannamalai District, who oversaw the evacuation of 1905 was tasked with overseeing the evacuation of Tiruvannamalai in 1908  also. As in the previous outbreak, he arranged for Bhagavan and a group of his devotees to shift to Pachaiamman temple. One of these devotees was Ganapathi Muni.\n\nKavyakanta Ganapati Muni, just three months before, in November 1907, had his spiritual doubts cleared by the Brahmana Swamy and had surrendered his life unto him. He had then named the latter as Ramana, Bhagavan and Maharshi. Bhagavan began calling the Muni as \u2018Nayana\u2019 an epithet used endearingly by the Muni\u2019s disciples of which there was a legion.\n\nPachaiamman temple was a regular stop for Bhagavan on his Girivalam and he and devotees would halt here and cook their food. Pachaiamman temple also served as a place for Bhagavan and devotees for taking their oil baths. They would bring oil and soap-nut powder from Virupaksha cave and bathe in the Pachaiamman temple tank whose waters were pure. It was during the return from one such oil bath with attendant Palaniswami and devotee Vasudeva Sastri that Bhagavan had his second death experience at tortoise rock. The first, as those familiar with Bhagavan\u2019s life story know, was at his home in Madurai in July 1896. In this, his second death experience, Bhagavan\u2019s vision was suddenly blinded by a \u2018curtain of bright light\u2019 and Vasudeva Sastri embraced him, weeping at seeing no respiration, the bluish tint of the skin and the sudden drop in body temperature, signs which could only mean one thing. After a few minutes, however, bodily functions resumed and Bhagavan stood up and returned to Virupaksha cave.\n\nBhagavan would recall decades later his swimming at Pachaiamman tank with Nayana\u2019s son, Mahadevan, who was about 6 years old then, riding on his back. This was during the plague epidemic of 1908:\n\n\u201cOne day I put Mahadevan on my back and began swimming in the tank opposite the Pachaiamman shrine from one end to the other. When we were halfway across, Mahadevan began pressing down on me, greatly elated, shouting \u2018hai, hai!\u2019 as cart drivers do to their bullocks. I was tired and it seemed as though both of us would be drowned. I was of course very anxious that he should be saved from such a catastrophe. I somehow managed to reach the other side.\u201d\n\nIt was from Pachaiamman temple that Bhagavan once set off alone to seek the source of a large banyan leaf that he found near the temple. Motivated by a sloka from the \u2018Arunachala Mahatmyam\u2019 that described Arunagiri Yogi as being in perpetual absorption beneath a banyan tree on the slopes of Arunachala, Bhagavan traced the direction from which the leaf had blown to see if he could locate the tree. Bhagavan started climbing the slopes of the Hill and sighted a banyan tree in the distance. Just then his leg inadvertently brushed against a bush that was home to a nest of hornets. The infuriated creatures came out in droves and began stinging Bhagavan\u2019s leg. Bhagavan chastising himself for his \u2018carelessness\u2019 stood quietly as the hornets took their revenge. Afterward, Bhagavan resumed his walk, and climbed to Seven Springs, and from there, back to Virupaksha Cave. Bhagavan did not say anything to Palaniswami but the latter noticed and asked Bhagavan what happened. Palaniswami applied sesame oil and removed the stingers that were still lodged in the skin. But the swelling in Bhagavan\u2019s leg remained for two more days.\n\nAt Pachaiamman temple Gambhiram Seshayya and others cooked for Bhagavan and his sadhus sometimes. Mostly it was Bhagavan who cooked. Rangaswami Iyengar who had been one of the residents in the 1905 quarantine saw to it that necessary provisions were made available. Mudaliar Patti also continued her daily food offerings to Bhagavan.\n\nThe Supreme Jnani delighted in playing with children with the same passion as he exhibited in answering serious spiritual  questions of true seekers.\n\nDELIGHTING CHILDREN\n\nManavasi Ramaswami Iyer, the Public Works Supervisor who made Tiruvannamalai his headquarters so that he could be near Bhagavan, often brought his two elder daughters to Pachaiamman temples to see Bhagavan.\n\nThe girls liked to play with Bhagavan and he would himself turn a child in their company. The children would pluck flowers from the nearby shrubs and give them to Bhagavan who would patiently string them into garlands. They would bring three or four large stones which they would christen as Rama, Seetha or Siva, Parvati etc., and bid Bhagavan bring water from the tank to perform abhisheka to the \u2018gods\u2019. Bhagavan would garland the \u2018gods\u2019 and do puja to them with the flowers. Once puja was over, the girls would offer pebbles as \u2018dakshina\u2019 to Bhagavan. Before the \u2018puja\u2019 Bhagavan would have finished the cooking and thus could do the naivedya, i.e., food offering to God, and give the girls and any others present portions as prasad.\n\nGANAPATI MUNI\n\nGanapathi Muni was among those that joined Bhagavan at Pachaiamman temple, having abandoned his retreat at Mango Tree Cave upon receiving the government orders.\n\nIt was at Mango Tree Cave that Ganapathi Muni began composing his Uma Sahasram. He had completed 700 verses but couldn\u2019t proceed further. Finally on 15th December 1907, the Muni sat before Bhagavan and under his inspiration composed the remaining three hundred verses.\n\nIt was only a few weeks after this event that the government gave orders for the evacuation. Ganapathi Muni continued to refine his Uma Sahasram at Pachaiamman temple, though he did not change even a word of the 300 verses of the poem that was inspired by Bhagavan\u2019s presence.\n\nOne early morning while Nayana and other disciples were sitting in front of Bhagavan who was in deep absorption, the Muni saw a bright, iridescent star descend from the sky and touch Bhagavan\u2019s forehead six times. Though deeply absorbed, Bhagavan was aware of what was going on at the time. Ganapathi Muni suddenly had the insight that Bhagavan was none other than Lord Subrahmanya and later described his experience in his verses in praise of Bhagavan beginning with the words \u2018\u092f\u093e\u0928\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0928 \u0915\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d \u0915\u0941\u0932\u092a\u0924\u093f yAnAyatra na kEkinAm kulapati\u2026.\u201d\n\nImage: Pachaiamman Temple tank where Bhagavan used to swim.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bfqy5g7x4re1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5d7737b9e46a5ad8da4ce29334caed68dac22e1\n\n",

        "title": "I feel horrible with a good friend getting drained in relationship but can't do anything about it.",
        "selftext": "I 27F, had went through a very difficult relationship few years ago, to an extent I still hesitate to find a new one. But I came out strong, learned my lessons from experiences, also after that phase I am quite familiar with who is wrong and who is right for us in life thing. Very few people who were there with me in that phase and one I made friends in the process. So I would always have an admiration and gratitude for them.\n\nMy friend is an extremely talented guy. He had been on top of his career ever since he joined, a guy with a lot of positive energy and very comforting to listen to. We live in different cities, not like we talk everyday or totally emotionally dependent on each other but when we do we often talk about how we have crossed the phase of maintaining a friendship with norms.\n\n1.5 years ago, he told me he met a new jr at work. I teased him he said he isn't interested but she seems good girl. So eventually he probably needed an easy escape he said his jr is interested in him.(He was actually  trying to get out of an one sided love at that time with someone else at that time) so may be it was easy escape for him so he casually started going out with the jr. Eventually became part of her circle too. Till then of course I was happy looking at my friend finally moving ahead in life. Whenever we talked I asked him how is it going! He kept saying he isn't sure. They are taking things casually she is a nice girl but they want different things from life. Knowing how he described her even I understood this is not something meant to last forever. \n\nBut since last one year, the girl wanted commitment which is fair enough. He wasn't ready for it but she kind of gave him hard times in his office circle like he is toxic. After 2 3 months he too gave a nod as it would be wrong to left a girl played around if she was that serious. Things started going downhill in his life ever since then. We understood this is where he lost the grip, he tried hard to convince himself ready for a relationship. To take the matter ahead they started living together.\n\nThings started going downhill ever since that. He lost connection with his family, with his friends, his social circle and importantly he has become extremely lazy to his work demands. Everyone in our limited circle talks about him changing himself to adjust with her norms. It should be cute but it's not. Even though I too had a hint but which is fine, if he found peace in love. \n\nBut then they broke up again 6 months ago. After the first break up he told me he wasn't happy at all. She is nice girl but they totally have different lifestyles. She is more of a girl who loves party social media, she wants that attention from her boyfriend. But he had been old school lover, taking your time relationship, understanding each other's better before going public. All I understood from she isn't ambitious at all, but he is. But she wants to be part of it, not in a very positive way. It's like she wants to be referred over someone deserving because of course partners do that  for each other. \n\nHe kind of was depressed about his whole life being on social media, he changed his company so that they can now have at least a gap at workplace to make things work better. But yet he wasn't happy inside so when he cut his ties he was happy energetic person all over again. Got back in touch with his family. She wanted to be his plus one officially in his new office circle. He even gave a chance at everything but it didn't work.\n\nBut then Idk may be living alone makes you take decisions, or once you are with a person for long you become addicted they again got back together 2 months ago. This time he didn't let any of us know. We were shocked to know through social media. He completely has cut his ties off with the friends and family again. She has toned down her social media but only to the friends living him with she is doing it because she wants to convince him how she understands him, the day he again gave her public commitment she will get back to herself again to show off she has won him. No girl would have stayed with an unsure man for that long who isn't ready for her even if I call my friend a toxic man here. And this is 100% happening as it has become an ego war between her and his family-friends. \n\nNow I anyways don't talk to hom often so I have nothing to comment on it but the friends who live with him in the same city often discusses how drained  he has become. I speak to his parents though, his mother has requested me to make him understand what's going wrong with it. Hos family is getting restless about his sudden change because they have already lost their elder son. As per them they don't want to control his life but as parents they can see what's going wrong. Him changing himself better for someone will never make him feel so hopeless but it's his self destructive attitude that's killing them. I just said I can't be part of it as it's not right. Other friends who did has given up already. \n\nAs a friend, I am worried for my friend who was there for me at my most difficult phase in life. I wish nothing but happiness for him if this one works out. But my friend didn't deserve to be drained in love. He extremely tries hard to be fit into her lifestyle but then he ends up feeling isolated because he loses his. \n\nAs a woman, I am feeling horrible for being too invested their relationship to an extent of getting it off my chest on reddit. Also I don't want to be too judgemental about the girl because I never met her personally.\n\nAgain, With purely human instinct I know the other friends are not wrong, this is kind of toxic and he cannot understand how to get out of it as it is very difficult to accept being in a toxic relationship than leaving one. \n\nOverall kind of mixed emotions I am going through, it's a very strong negative instinct. one point I can clearly see losing a friend forever, or losing his core forever he was meant for bigger things, another point being a female best friend I have to careful with my boundaries, being too intrusive can be taken wrong way, I have my career too. May be one day we are proven wrong he actually found his way out with her or may be he realized it before it is too late. \n\nWhatever it is I never thought it would feel this heavy and complicated. I am honestly very sad whenever I see his family. I really want to get it off my chest and give up on any negative thought now, Idk how to too. Everyone is so over exposed to each other's lives now by different means!",

From 2013 until now, I\u2019ve been feeling hopeless about when I\u2019ll actually achieve this goal.\n\nContext:  \nI'm 35 years old, married for six years, and we have one child. I love them, but I feel exhausted. I\u2019m the breadwinner and have provided everything I can to make them comfortable.\n\nBefore our child was born, my wife resigned from her job due to workplace power-tripping and to focus on our child. She asked me for capital to start a small online business, but the products ended up sitting unused. Then she asked for an oven, baking equipment, and paid online lessons because she wanted to learn how to bake and sell goods. She learned how to bake but never actively sold anything.\n\nWhenever I express my frustrations, she tries to look for an income source for a few days, but nothing comes out of it. It\u2019s frustrating because she always starts something but never follows through. I supported her in becoming self-employed, but then she considers doing something else. We\u2019ve argued about this multiple times, but the issue just fades away over time, which is getting tiring.\n\nIt\u2019s tough because I feel like I\u2019m handling the finances alone. Sometimes, I just want to cry. I manage to save about 20% percent of my net income every payday (not sure if that\u2019s enough for a family setup), but I know I shouldn\u2019t touch it.

If she stays like this, we\u2019ll end up with nothing.\n\nI work extremely hard, but I don\u2019t know how much more effort or how many promotions it will take to achieve financial stability. Every time I get promoted, it feels like I\u2019m starting from zero again, climbing an even steeper mountain with no guarantee of reaching the top.\n\nI\u2019m already at my breaking point, but I don\u2019t want to make any drastic decisions. Honestly, I never realized she had this trait\u2014being so passive and lacking the drive to aim higher. I always pray she finds something she truly wants to do so that we have some leeway to achieve our goals and feel alive.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of bringing up this issue that I just wrote down my thoughts in a notebook while making this post. It\u2019s hard to sleep when I feel like this.

(I might not even be alive by then.)\n* Working 11 hours a day\u2014how can I earn more?\n* Before I can buy something, there\u2019s always a new expense, making me feel like I\u2019m never getting ahead. It\u2019s exhausting.\n* This is a lot to carry\u2014long work hours, taking every opportunity possible, and dealing with constant frustration.\n* I want to see the same level of grit.\n* I want to see a good level of drive.\n* I don\u2019t feel like our goals are aligned.\n* I supported her path to self-employment, but now she\u2019s considering something else.

Sometimes I hear my dad's voice telling me to go to sleep. Sometimes him saying gibberish.The random noises are kind of unexplainable for me, like they kind of sound like the aftermath of holding an old bontempi's piano key for way too long. I don't know if that makes sense.Sorry. I know it sounds stupid and harmless, but I genuinely am going crazy. I seriously can't take it anymore.I wake up everyday to memories of him and keep hearing his voice,and yesterday while trying to sleep(with only a small nightling beside the other side of the couch) i saw something that resembled his face. I have to admit I'm a scaredy cat,i get scared very easily and when i do i cover myself up with my sheets and have a full blown anxiety attack.But I never have had problems like this before. And it's messing me up so terribly; i can't sleep,study or eat properly. I did terribly this week in shcool because of this. I feel unsafe,unprotected in this house.Like I'm in danger. I  don't know why. I genuinely cannot continue on like this anymore. My mom thinks I'm going crazy. Right now,it's 02:21 AM and I cannot sleep without feeling anxious. I've kept my lights open because im so scared. Im so tired.I dont even know whats going on.",

Tomorrow, I\u2019ll just leave it on my desk\u2014maybe she\u2019ll read it while I\u2019m at work. :(\n\n# Notes from my notebook:\n\n* I\u2019m frustrated.\n* Holding onto a goal for over a decade and feeling stuck is frustrating.\n* Doing my best to provide, but it\u2019s still not enough.\n* Balancing the budget while chasing the goal makes me feel like it\u2019s out of reach. (I might not even be alive by then.)\n* Working 11 hours a day\u2014how can I earn more?\n* Before I can buy something, there\u2019s always a new expense, making me feel like I\u2019m never getting ahead. It\u2019s exhausting.\n* This is a lot to carry\u2014long work hours, taking every opportunity possible, and dealing with constant frustration.\n* I want to see the same level of grit.\n* I want to see a good level of drive.\n* I don\u2019t feel like our goals are aligned.\n* I supported her path to self-employment, but now she\u2019s considering something else. (I really want to see a firm plan!)\n* I invested in those dreams only to see them shift without real progress.\n* Breaking point.\n\n# ",

I had our daughter January 4th 2024, and she was 5 weeks and 3 days early because of how stressed and depressed I was. \n\nIn the time between his death and her birth, I had the police called on me twice. Once because I ran from home with the intent to buy a firearm and end my life, and the second time because I had expressed to my brother through text that I wanted to die sooner rather than later. My water actually broke a little bit after the cops spoke to me and left my house.\n\nIt has now been almost 15 months since his passing, and I still can't hardly function. Every time my daughter reaches a milestone, I feel so much guilt for being the parent who's here. My daughter looks so much life her dad that it kills me a little each time I see her giggle and smile. He wanted so badly to be a dad, and he loved her so much before she was born. \n\nTangled was on TV a couple nights ago and I was watching it while putting my baby to sleep, and the scene where Flynn dies in Rapunzels arms made me have a complete breakdown. I don't often let myself openly cry and vent out my feelings, but watching that scene broke something in me and I cried until I was shaking and couldn't catch my breath. I felt like I was dieing.\n\nI thought I was healing. I don't feel the need to text him every single day anymore, I can talk about him with other people and make stupid jokes about him being gone as a way to cope. But it felt like any progress I've made was ripped away and I've been thrown back to point zero. \n\nSometimes I'll even get this stinging pain in my chest like my heart is physically breaking. I don't have anyone really to talk to about this, and I feel like I've become obsessed with him and showing people how heavy my grief is. I mean, I have 2 tattoos for him, I drew our family twice and I have a shrine for him in my room. Maybe I'm losing my mind. Idk but nothing feels real and I wish I'd wake up tomorrow and this all be some fucked up dream.",

No energy, no direction, just quiet panic that I couldn\u2019t explain to anyone. I couldn\u2019t afford therapy. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. So I started drawing. And somehow, that saved me.\n\nThrough art, I started listening to myself \u2014 really listening. Line by line, I began to see what I had buried inside for years. That\u2019s how Mindologue was born.\n\n**What is Mindologue?**\n\nIt\u2019s a healing system that combines art therapy, psychology, and AI \u2014 designed for people who want to understand themselves deeply, privately, and honestly.\n\n**The Book: Unfolding Your True Self**\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a book to read \u2014 it\u2019s a space to work through emotions. Every page gives you a task: draw, reflect, feel, understand. No fluff. No clich\u00e9s. Just tools that actually work.\n\n  \n**You\u2019ll learn how to:**\n\n\u2022 Calm anxiety through art\n\n\u2022 Understand what\u2019s holding you back\n\n\u2022 Reconnect with your desires, identity, and direction\n\n\u2022 Process emotional pain (breakups, burnout, fear, apathy, and more)\n\n\u2022 Start dreaming again \u2014 with clarity\n\n\n\n**It\u2019s the kind of book you return to whenever life breaks you open.**\n\n# The App: Mindologue\n\nThe app takes things even further. You draw. The AI analyzes it \u2014 based on real art therapy methods. Then you receive personalized guidance, like:\n\n\u2022 Emotional insights\n\n\u2022 Meditations and healing techniques\n\n\u2022 Deep questions for reflection\n\n\u2022 Voice-based interpretation (optional)\n\n\u2022 An evolving journal that tracks your progress\n\n\u2022 Crisis mode: AI support when you\u2019re overwhelmed\n\n**It\u2019s not another mood tracker.**\n\nIt\u2019s a mirror for your subconscious \u2014 and a tool to help you grow.\n\nI built Mindologue for people who are tired of pretending they\u2019re okay.\n\nFor those who need a way to process pain \u2014 quietly, safely, affordably.\n\n  \nThis isn\u2019t about fixing you. It\u2019s about unfolding you. Because everything you need is already inside. You just need a way to access it.\n\n**That\u2019s what Mindologue gives you.**",

However, the score came out to be much lower than what I expected since in the mocks it ranged between 157-162. \n\nI plan to retake the test in 6-8 weeks. I've gone through a lot of Greg's posts and comments. I think he would suggest that I go through the 'I am overwhelmed plan' for Quant and 1 month plan for Verbal. \n\nHere are my few questions: \n\n1. Do I need to watch the complete overwhelmed plan or should I take the quizzes shared by Greg and listen only to videos which indicate my weak areas? \n2. After going through the plan, what do I consult for the Quant Strategy? \n3. Is the verbal 1 month plan enough to give myself a chance to push my score up to 165? If not, what do I need to supplement it with? \n4. When should I start giving mocks? \n\nApologies for the long post.

        "selftext": "I was in need of a new keyboard and bought a V1 Max (red linear) $100 as my first mechanical keyboard. Being used to Lenovo thinkpad keyboard layout the explosives layout felt awkward so I did some research and found the k2 to be similar but with a compact layout. Decided to buy the K2 HE Standard $130 (purple nebular)to do a compare.\n\nMy main use is gaming playing Dota2 and home general computer use.\n\nThe TLDR: The K2 has my desired layout that allows me to use it without having to look at the board. When I do have to look, the illuminated see through keycaps take me right where I need to go. All # and F keys are in reach of the WASD. The V1 has a superior typing experience and aesthetic but was inferior for my gaming use case. If the V1 Max had a compact layout and see through keys, it probably would have been my preferred keyboard for the features/price. Overall I really like both boards and wish I could keep both but the wife said no lol.   \n\nI also considered the Royal Kludge 75% board which is very similar to the K2 but opted for the K2 because I was digging the Keychron V1 Max despite the layout. \n\nPersonal Preference Pros and Cons below\n\nV1 Max Pros/Cons:\n\nPros: \n-Overall less expensive ~$100 at the time of purchase\n\n-Very smooth typing experience. The keycaps feel like they hug your finger tips with the subtle curvature. The linear reds pressed very smooth and effortlessly\n\n-volume knob is a really nice feature for quick and easy volume adjustment/mute\n\n-Appearance was very cool, the color scheme reminds me of cockpit controls which i really liked and was overall very subtle and not \u201cgamey\u201d. \n\nCons:\n-Layout was less suitable for gaming. I need to be able to snap to the escape and F keys very quickly so the exploaded layout made that a reach I\u2019m not used to. I used the keyboard for about a week and was getting used to it but overall I was missing important key strokes on the top row.\n\n-Keycaps are not shine through, i play in the dark a lot. \n\n-Spacebar key sounds like shit, maybe by design but was hollow and loud sounding. \n\nK2 HE Standard Pros/Cons:\n\nPros:\n-Layout of the compact 75 with full F row is \nthe preferred layout for my use case.\n\n-Appearance, the black board with the RGB and see through keycaps is just cool looking. I set the RGB to solid rotate on slowest setting and enjoy the colors.\n\n-build feels much more solid/heavy than the V1 Max.\n\n-Keycaps have a more natural feel to me. I looked it up and the standard k2 does have different style cap which feel flatter wider and easier to move between as opposed to the V1 Max where I felt like the caps had almost a smaller platform/target\n\n-Number row is slightly raised making it really easy to feel my way around my key position without having to look.\n\nCons:\n-Key press is much stiffer than the V1 Max which doesn\u2019t feel as nice to type on. It\u2019s a more spongy springing feel with more resistance. If the K2 had the key depress feel of the V1 Max I would like it a lot more!\n\n-No volume knob!\n\n-Appearance - Despite having a cooler look, I don\u2019t like the \u201cgamey\u201d aesthetic as much, but it can be toned down\n\n-HE, I really have not use for this feature I don\u2019t think so the specialized switches actually make the keyboard less customizable for me if i want to change switches down the road. Also adds a more premium price tag.\n \n",

        "selftext": "I (40sF) have always tried to be a good person. Taking care of others before myself, don't bather others with my problems, etc. By 30 I had overcome a bad 1st marriage, took care of my son, remarried a wonderful man and added another child as well as completed school for my chosen career. However, my mild depression/anxiety began to take over. I ended up really struggling for awhile and then had some physical health issues contribute to the problems. I slipped into overmedicating and trying to white knuckle life, assuming it would get better. It didn't. I left my dream career and tried to pull it together. I managed for a few years and then had another health issue come up and it lead to overmedicating again and ended up with a Legal issue. While trying to just survive and fight daily against suicidal ideation due to a condition that required a risky surgery, I couldn't handle the fight required to overcome this. The financial and mental toll it was going to take to fight this false accusation by a doctor I met only twice, eventhough my primary doc fought for me, was just too much. I ended up taking a misdemeanor plea to make it go away as I had to go ahead with a risky surgery. I had a major complications after the surgery and ended up fighting to get better for several years. \n\nI am finally feeling better after really focusing on getting better with the right doctors, meds and counseling. The last year and a half I have felt better than I have my whole adult life. And I want to get back to working, helping people and generally living rather than hiding from the embarrassment of my mistakes, which is what I have been doing for over 7 years. \n\nMy question is how do I face the questions that will undoubtedly come up because of my background? I always look for the best in people, I like helping people who need it and I am very non judgemental. But I am still embarrassed by my mistakes and in a small town, I will always run into people who only know the gossip version of those issues. It is very hard for me to face that. My counselor told me once that it is kind of crazy to think that people from 7+ years ago are still thinking about me, lol. Which I get her point. I am stuck on those issues and maybe everyone else has moved on. But what do I say to possible new employers? Do I go ahead and mention that I have had some struggles in the past but have been fortunate enough to overcome them and hope they don't judge me too harshly or do I just wait and see if they bring it up? I tend to over explain so I try to just answer what is asked but I know that, based on the rest of my history, these issues will come as a surprise. I still feel ashamed and embarrassed. If the tables were turned I would easily give someone the benefit of the doubt, give credit for overcoming hard times etc. How do I get to a place where I allow that same grace for myself? ",

Maybe a month ago he had a pretty severe episode where he had back leg weakness, lots of back pain, and wobbled a lot. Pain meds and rest got him back to where he could walk mostly normal, use the bathroom fine. Yesterday he sort of regressed back to being wobbly, so I scheduled to bring him to the vet to get the same meds. Before his appointment he collapsed in the middle of the night and started dragging his legs, could not use either one at all. We assumed that not being able to afford surgery, we'd be putting him down today. But we got there and he still had deep pain response in his toes and he can still poop and pee, albeit with a lot of difficulty. So the vet gave us a harness for walking him, Prednisone, tramadol, and another pain med. He's crated, and I can't really stand seeing him in such a pathetic state without the use of his legs. He has always been very neurotic and anxious so this is very mentally hard on him, and obviously physically as well. Have people had success at this stage without surgery? I really hate to drag this out and have him in such an upsetting state for a while just to ultimately put him down. \n\nAdditionally, looking for suggestions on how to allow for peeing and pooping while using the harness. He pooped at the vet office just dragging his legs behind him and we are not supposed to let him do that. He peed with the harness pushing on his boy parts and it just kind of went everywhere but that's fine, it's the pooping that confuses me as to how that's supposed to work. Any advice appreciated ",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, first I will say I'm sorry for any grammatical errors, English is not my first language, and sorry not sorry because this will be a LONG ride, and a Little sad and full of problems in one time.\n\nAnd also, this is my first time posting on Reddit ever, but truly wanted to do it in this beatiful community <3\n\nThis maybe is going to be a little messy, 'cause I'm quite emotional lately but I'll try my best to make it coherent enough.\n\nI'll use some fake names for privacy reasons of course.\n\nI'll start giving context I (32F) have been with my BF (33M) (I'll call him \"Julius\") for almost 5 years together, we've been living together for 4. We've met when the country was still on the pandemic, but when the quarentine was less strict. For me it was love almost instantly, I was single for 4 or 5 years before I met him, so when I though I found someone that was meeting my standards I was over the moon with joy and love. At the beggining of the situationship we were I stand my ground about what I wanted, and that is that I'd always wanted to get married but I didn't wanted to have kids (I had a very traumatic childhood because of my mother so I always felt I'd be a horrible mother) I was firm about that, he said he was ok with it so we continued to know each other and after almost 6 months I said to him I loved him, he didn't answered it back right then, but a couple of days after he said it back and we started the relationship there. Everything was great and after some months we decided to live together. For this I'll give some context, it's not that any of us had a place for our own, we both lived with our mothers basically (before jumping to conclusions that is a red flag or something in our country the renting or place buying is almost something imposible, we live in Argentina, I'll just say the economy here makes really difficult for anyone to live by their own if you don't make Good money) so, he was living on a room that was on the yard of his mother's house, so the kitchen and bathroom were shared between his mom and Little brother and us, obviously that wasn't something bad at first. Another piece of context, by the time we started dating I was working cleaning a house, because the pandemic made me lose my former job (I worked as a cooking assistant on a catering) so I was almost jobless (because the paid wasn't Good enough to anything) and I was in the verge of changing carreers, before moving in with him I alredy started studying an IT carreer, so he knew how it was my job situation before asking me to move in, and he also knew, because I was clear about everything, that I was battling some mental health issues (I battled with depression and anxiety since I was 15 with 2 suicide attempts on my back, not proud but part of my story) Well, everything was nice and beautiful at first, but fastforward a year in the future, we're now at 2022, on the last day of April I lost my stepfather to a long battle of tuberculosis, he was the only father figure I had the last 15 years since my father left and run to another country, since I was alredy battling my depression without a profesional help this only made it stronger, I was devastated and didn't had the energy to even exist, to put an extra weigh I was in exam time on my college\u2026 so everything was just adding up and I was doing my best to exist and try to do the things I was supposed to do, but one thing was way out of my priority list and that was sex. Since I was with the least sexual energy and was to put it in words \"apathic\" because I was FRICKING DEPRESSED, he though I was having an affair\u2026 ok I can understand that my lack of sexual energy could give that vibe, but he didn't even try to talk with me about that or didn't even try to understand that really was my depression and not anything else, I guess you know were I'm going with this, he did in fact cheated on me... I knew it, I had the suspision that he cheated with his friend from other country that came to visit, I call it femenine intuition because I didn't had proof, so I confronted him with that and he admitted it, I was heartbroken, more when he told me his reasoning to do it \"I though you were cheating and that was why you were less sexually\" I never cheated, ever. So I texted my best friend we'll call him \"Nick\" and asked him if he and his GF we'll call her \"Melanie\" (who I dearly love because she such an angel) if they were okay if I crashed on their couch for the night cause I couldn't stand sleeping on the same bed as Julius. I went to their home and talk and cried for hours, since I was still having the pain from my stepfather passing away and now this I was so fricking messed up mentally. In the conversation Nick and Melanie asked me if I was willing to forgive the cheating or if I wanted to break up, I was deeply in love and always battled with self deprecation son self love was not a thing in my dictionary, clearly\u2026 I said I was willing to forgive but with conditions, and they said something I took really with me, they said \"Remember if you forgive you have to let go, you can't get attached to the fact he cheated because forgiving is about letting go and giving the chance to make things good again\" I think about it for some days before coming back to the place we shared, I (much to my actual regret) decided to forgive and gave the chance to fix the relationship. I'll say that I've got somehing great from this experience, this made me take a step and seek professional help and started therapy for my depression and suicidal thoughs, 2 years after psicological and psichiatric treatment I've got the help so much needed and finished my treatment (hooray for that)\n\nWell things went well for quite some time, we had Good times and not so Good time. I was studying a lot to get my career through and stopped working as for his petition, so I could focus my 100% on the study and we made a deal he'd support us with the condition that when I work on my field and make Good money I'd buy us a car, ok no big deal for me, it's something I would also like, so I agree (remember this deal), he worked but didn't make big money, so we lived through rough times, but he had a downside I wasn't expecting at first when we started living together, one is that he really really loves getting delivery food, me on the other hand likes it as a treat not as an all week meal plan, the problem with this love he had with delivery is that he used his own credit card A LOT to do this (since he was the one with the money I felt I hadn't a say on the matters of how he spends his money) months later he told me the debt he had with his credit card (if you watched How I Met Your Mother is like the scene where Marshall found the credit card debt Lily had) he had maxed it out and couldn't afford to pay it, so he took a loan on his work and paid the debt, then he asked me if I could do the finances of the house a.k.a he gave me his monthly pay and let me control it, we made it through a lot of time, but since I'm a little rat, to put it in words, and prefer to live frugal but without debt and with that I didn't mind to say no to treats and delivery and all the things he loved, almost 3 months later he decided he no longer wanted me to do the finances. That's ok by me, a thing less to worry in the mental load I already had, because I forget to mention, he's not the cleanest nor organized person I've met, so cleaning and cooking is almost something I have to worry about\u2026 \n\nAlso, I forget to mention something else that is important, remeber how I said on the beggining I dind't wanted kids and he agreed? Well, time in the relationship he admitted he did wanted kids and I quote what he said \"I resigned to the idea of being a father because of you\" so basically he guilt tripped me into rethink that (this was before the cheating) so I rethinked it and said maybe I could think more about it and I could change my mind. Yeah so, I said when we have a house on our own, a Little more of economic stability and I finished my career I would maybe say yes, but after getting married and after 35, just to have some time in case and to enjoy my professional life, since I've always been a career driven person.\n\nSo, were we left it before this pause, we were out of debt, he was managing his money again and I was studying and doing almost all the house work, oh by the way it's not like he has to go to work all the days to the office, he Works remote for all the month except 2 to 3 days that he has to go to the office, 2 to 3 days on the month, not the week, the month honey\u2026 so yes, he's home most of the time and he can do chores, but if I don't say to him exactly what it has to be done he doesn't even notice it. I guess you'll be counting red flags by the dozen right now, let me tell you I was deeply in love that I've never noticed them\n\nFast forward again, we're now on November 2023, I was on my last year of college, exam time again (the timing for the thing that happens always is so damn bad) I was preparing one last Project we had to submit for our final grade, I receive a call from my mom, she tells me she's not feeling Good, I asked a few question and noticed it was serious, I tell her to wait there and I call a friend of hers and asked to take her to the hospital, since I live an hour away I wasn't going to be as quick as her, I called an uber an went as far as I could to the hospital she took her, quite some time an some incompetent ER doctors that wanted to realese her with the blood pressure sky rocketing and just a note to see a cardiologyst, I took her in that moment to the cardiologyst and he asked why they relesed her if she was having a fricking stroke, he wrote a note (since he worked on the same hospital) and told to took her to the ER again, they took the note, check her vitals and put her in the ICU, and she was hospitalized for a week almost, again bad timing for everything, almost lost my mother, we had to move to her house for that time with our cats, what takes us to the next problema that happened in that time one of our cats because of the stress of being on an unknown place with other cats developed an urinary infection, so December 2023 my mom was Good but now my cat was sick, he had 3 catheters in the span of a month, so I was dealing with that stress, exam stress and almost losing my mother stress, on the 26 of December to add up to ALL THAT one of the cats I had went missing (sadly we never found him, still miss him), so I wasn't suprised when my period didn't came on time that month because all that stress really was something that could make me be late... but when a week passed and still no period I started worrying, so I took a pregnancy test on January 3rd, to my surprise it was positive, I was shocked, we had almost nothing of sex because everything that was going on, but maybe one time we had a slip and didn't noticed\u2026 by the moment I found out I was pregnant, the vets also told us that our cat had to go to surgery urgent, because he could die, we took the dollars I had on savings (gifted by my aunt over the years) an exchanged them to pay the cat's surgery, the cat survived they had to remove his penis completly, but he was fine and we were happy with that. So, on the pregnancy thing, we weren't having a Good economic situation so we both decided the best was not to have it (and of course I didn't wanted to have it right now cause as I said earlier I wanted my degree and a work, and also get married before) but life has bigger plans in mind and the universe Heard it, and dind't wanted me to feel horrible for going for an abortion, so the stress of the cats surgery and everything made me have a miscarriage through the span of a week (it was painful both phisically and mentally) but it was the best. 2 weeks later I've got a job and was doing great, but 3 monthslater the company I was working for decided they didn't want to renew my contract (here we have a 3 month contract probation time, so if 3 month go by the companies can fire you without cause and without indemnization) so again jobless, but still looking for a job.\n\nI promise you, this is the last bit of the long story! Our last fast forward, to November 2024, again Julius had made a big credit card debt, this time was not only stupid things he buyed, but also the monthly food, so 50/50 his lack of financial control and the country's economic russian roulette\u2026 by this time we had and argoument with his mom about the services, we payed for them, as we lived there, but her never even turn of a light so the bills were too damn high for us to pay, so he tried to talk to her about that and how we couldn't afford them so she had to help, she wouldn't hear it, so the argument scalated to her trying to kick us out, in this moment I finally found a job, the one I'm currently at, and gave me a really Good pay, so we could afford a prefabricated house to put on the back, and put services to Julius name for our home. Remember we're having a debt, so when we bought the house we we're out of the money we were going to use to pay that debt, so I had the \"amazing\" idea to take a loan with my bank to help him pay a fraction of that debt, to put it in dollar the debt was almost 2/3k, so in my country's currency that's A LOT, so yeah I went also into debt just to help him pay a fraction of that. So now, he still uses irresponsibly his credit card, so the debt never left us, and I'm also paying my loan.\n\nSo, to the question of this post, the relation is struggling since half a year, we're not having our best time, I'm pretty tired of absolutly everything, he's no longer being caring, loving or supporting as he always was, he keep saying a lot of things that hurts me and never apologize and always deflects it towards me, everytime I said \"I remember X thing being this way\" and doesn't line up what he remembers, he says I'm gaslighting him, everytime I try to open up about something it hurts me, he says I put on defensive an don't listen to him, and that I'm on the wrong\u2026\n\nSo with all this much context, and belive me I summarized a lot of what happened and what's going on, I'm feeling tired of this relationship, I'm feeling unloved and lacking romance at all, or basic comprehension\u2026 \n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot, remember how I said earlier, remeber the car thing because it's important later, well a few weeks ago, he had a Little meltdown about not having a car, and how I didn't bought it, well I kept saying we need to be better economically to buy a car, and he put an ultim\u00e1tum, he said \"If by the time I'm 40 you didn't bought a car and I have to buy it myself, we Will end this relationship\" \u2026 So yeah, he's being a Little too much with that, also as I said, I wish to get married, and being saying this to him, not hinting saying it directly, that I want him to propose and enjoy the engagement, but he always say \"We need to have a lot of money to get married because I want a big party\" (It's not like we can have a 200 guest wedding, if we have 50 people max is a lot, so no need to throw the house out of the Windows) but I reluctantly agreed\u2026 \n\nSo then, with ALL this in mind, I've been really considering to break up with him, but the only thing that makes me reconsider is the debt, I don't feel comfortable leaving him with the credit card debt by his own, but I can't take it anymore really, I spent more time sad and crying than I spent happy in this relationship. So would I be the asshole if I break up with him and leave him by his own with the credit card debt that he was stupid enough to not listen to me and not keep getting it bigger?\n\nAgain I'm so so sorry if I written a lot and put almost all the story for context, but belive me I left a lot behind to tell.\n\nThanks if you answer, and thanks to our potato queen Charlotte for giving us this safe space to ask for guidance and help. Love you Charlotte <3\n\nI Will accept my judgement even if I'm the ahole\n\nThanks for Reading, I truly needed to get this out of my chest.\n\nLove you all <3",

I would say that I am very close with Allah SWT, and would consider a good muslim in a lot of aspects of it as i follow the sunnah and do my five daily prayers everyday and pray sunnah rakat, have been fasting everyday for Ramadan, giving zakat and changing a lot of my old bad habits such as smoking, drinking, swearing, and listening to haram music. But the one thing i cant get past is going to the mosque because of my extreme social anxiety. I do my best to go and i force myself to go at time, even to pray taraweeh, but the entire time i feel so miserable and anxious and always having these what if thoughts. Last time i was there for fajr prayer i was reading quran and could barely breathe cause of how anxious i felt and since then i feel like i need to speak up and wonder what i should do. Ive attended live streams to pray taraweeh, is this okay? Am i doing enough that maybe its okay if i stay home? I dont want any hate and want it to be clear i do WANT to go to mosque, but mentally its very hard for me. Any tips, anyone who deals with the same?",

I recently went volunteering and it was pretty fun with some people my age, but I ended up doing a position where I wasn\u2019t really with the main group because the leader asked me to. I joined near the end, and will go again, but I just feel really discouraged, isolated, and stupid. \n\nAll i do is work, go home, sleep/eat, play video games.

        "selftext": "No probiotic ever helped me the way Prime Biome has. Within three weeks, my digestion was noticeably better\u2014no more bloating or stomach cramps.\n\nIn recent years, probiotics have gained significant traction in the health and wellness industry, with numerous products claiming to support digestive and skin health. However, one supplement has stood out in 2025\u2014Prime Biome. This revolutionary probiotic gummy is designed to enhance overall well-being by improving gut health, promoting skin rejuvenation, and optimizing nutrient absorption. But how does Prime Biome compare to other similar supplements on the market? Let\u2019s dive into a comprehensive analysis, including a comparative discussion with related products.\n\nDiscover More About Prime Biome\n\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0>>>CLICK HERE READ REVIEW THEN BUY AT OFFICIAL WEBSITES\n\nUnderstanding Prime Biome\n\nPrime Biome is a cutting-edge probiotic supplement formulated to support both gut and skin health. Its unique approach leverages the gut-skin axis\u2014the scientifically established link between the microbiome and skin appearance\u2014to improve digestion, boost immunity, and promote a radiant complexion.\n\n# Key Benefits of Prime Biome\n\n* Enhanced Gut Health: Balances the microbiome, reducing bloating (75% of users report reduced bloating within two weeks), gas, and constipation.\n* Skin Rejuvenation: Supports collagen production and accelerates skin cell turnover, reducing fine lines and dullness (80% of users noticed improved skin texture within a month).\n* Improved Nutrient Absorption: Ensures efficient breakdown and assimilation of essential nutrients.\n* Anti-Inflammatory Properties: Combats gut and skin inflammation, promoting a healthier body from within.\n* Convenient & Tasty Gummies: Easy to consume and free from artificial additives (92% of customers prefer the gummy format over traditional capsules).\n\n# Key Ingredients in Prime Biome\n\nPrime Biome contains a proprietary blend of probiotics, herbs, and botanicals that enhance gut and skin health:\n\n1. Bacillus Coagulans \u2013 A potent probiotic that withstands stomach acid and promotes digestive balance (98% survival rate in stomach acid conditions).\n2. Babchi \u2013 A medicinal herb known for its ability to improve skin texture and collagen production.\n3. Fenugreek & Inulin \u2013 Prebiotic fibers that fuel good gut bacteria, improving digestion and skin health.\n4. Lemon Balm \u2013 A calming herb that alleviates stress, reducing its impact on skin and digestion.\n5. Organic Ceylon Ginger \u2013 A natural anti-inflammatory that soothes digestive discomfort.\n6. Organic Lion\u2019s Mane \u2013 Supports cognitive function while boosting gut microbiota.\n7. Slippery Elm Bark \u2013 A gut-soothing agent that enhances nutrient absorption.\n\n# Related Products: How Prime Biome Compares to Other Probiotics\n\n# Bio-Kult\n\nBio-Kult is a well-known probiotic supplement that comes in capsule form, containing a multi-strain blend of beneficial bacteria. While it offers digestive support, it lacks prebiotics and does not specifically target skin health. Unlike Prime Biome, which includes Bacillus Coagulans, Bio-Kult relies on a variety of probiotic strains that may not survive stomach acid as effectively. Users report improvements in general gut health, but the product does not address skin concerns as Prime Biome does.\n\n# Seed Probiotic\n\nSeed Probiotic is a high-quality probiotic supplement designed for gut microbiome balance. It utilizes a scientifically formulated multi-strain blend and delayed-release capsules to enhance bacterial survival through digestion. While Seed Probiotic includes some strains beneficial for digestion, it lacks the gut-skin axis support found in Prime Biome. Users report a 55-60% reduction in bloating, which is slightly lower than the 75% improvement seen with Prime Biome.\n\n# Align Probiotic\n\nAlign Probiotic is a digestive health supplement that primarily contains Bifidobacterium, a strain known for its targeted digestive support. Unlike Prime Biome, Align does not include prebiotics, which limits its ability to foster long-term gut health. Align users have noted relief from digestive discomfort, but the product does not offer additional benefits such as skin hydration or collagen support. Those looking for a more comprehensive probiotic may find Prime Biome to be a better option.\n\n# Comparing Probiotic Benefits\n\nOne of the major advantages of Prime Biome over other probiotic brands is its dual-functionality. Unlike Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align, Prime Biome targets both gut and skin health. It enhances collagen production, improves hydration, and supports skin renewal\u2014all while maintaining digestive balance. Other probiotics mainly focus on gut microbiome balance but do not address external wellness, making Prime Biome a more comprehensive solution.\n\n# Why Prime Biome Stands Out\n\nPrime Biome is specifically formulated to support the gut-skin axis, a unique feature not found in many competing probiotic supplements. While most brands focus solely on digestion, Prime Biome acknowledges the interconnectedness of gut health and skin clarity. By reducing inflammation and supporting the microbiome, it provides users with benefits beyond typical digestion-focused probiotics.\n\n# User Satisfaction and Effectiveness\n\nCustomer reviews indicate that Prime Biome has a 94% satisfaction rate, which is significantly higher than other probiotics. Users appreciate its easy-to-consume gummy format, skin benefits, and fast-acting digestive support. In comparison, Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align Probiotic have satisfaction rates ranging from 75% to 82%, indicating that Prime Biome is preferred by a larger segment of users.\n\n# Final Verdict on Probiotic Comparisons\n\nPrime Biome outperforms its competitors by offering dual benefits for both gut and skin health. While other probiotics like Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align help with digestion, they do not provide the additional benefits of collagen support, skin hydration, and microbiome-driven skin renewal. Those seeking a probiotic that offers more than just digestive relief will find Prime Biome to be a standout choice.\n\n# Customer Testimonials: Real Results, Real Impact\n\n* Dahish, Los Angeles, CA:\u00a0*\u201cPrime Biome has transformed my skin and digestion. My breakouts have reduced significantly, and my gut feels healthier than ever!\u201d*\u00a0(Reported a 90% decrease in acne flare-ups)\n* Shibby, Florida:\u00a0*\u201cI was skeptical at first, but this supplement exceeded my expectations.

Within three weeks, my digestion was noticeably better\u2014no more bloating or stomach cramps.\n\nIn recent years, probiotics have gained significant traction in the health and wellness industry, with numerous products claiming to support digestive and skin health. However, one supplement has stood out in 2025\u2014Prime Biome. This revolutionary probiotic gummy is designed to enhance overall well-being by improving gut health, promoting skin rejuvenation, and optimizing nutrient absorption. But how does Prime Biome compare to other similar supplements on the market? Let\u2019s dive into a comprehensive analysis, including a comparative discussion with related products.\n\nDiscover More About Prime Biome\n\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0>>>CLICK HERE READ REVIEW THEN BUY AT OFFICIAL WEBSITES\n\nUnderstanding Prime Biome\n\nPrime Biome is a cutting-edge probiotic supplement formulated to support both gut and skin health. Its unique approach leverages the gut-skin axis\u2014the scientifically established link between the microbiome and skin appearance\u2014to improve digestion, boost immunity, and promote a radiant complexion.\n\n# Key Benefits of Prime Biome\n\n* Enhanced Gut Health: Balances the microbiome, reducing bloating (75% of users report reduced bloating within two weeks), gas, and constipation.\n* Skin Rejuvenation: Supports collagen production and accelerates skin cell turnover, reducing fine lines and dullness (80% of users noticed improved skin texture within a month).\n* Improved Nutrient Absorption: Ensures efficient breakdown and assimilation of essential nutrients.\n* Anti-Inflammatory Properties: Combats gut and skin inflammation, promoting a healthier body from within.\n* Convenient & Tasty Gummies: Easy to consume and free from artificial additives (92% of customers prefer the gummy format over traditional capsules).\n\n# Key Ingredients in Prime Biome\n\nPrime Biome contains a proprietary blend of probiotics, herbs, and botanicals that enhance gut and skin health:\n\n1. Bacillus Coagulans \u2013 A potent probiotic that withstands stomach acid and promotes digestive balance (98% survival rate in stomach acid conditions).\n2. Babchi \u2013 A medicinal herb known for its ability to improve skin texture and collagen production.\n3. Fenugreek & Inulin \u2013 Prebiotic fibers that fuel good gut bacteria, improving digestion and skin health.\n4. Lemon Balm \u2013 A calming herb that alleviates stress, reducing its impact on skin and digestion.\n5. Organic Ceylon Ginger \u2013 A natural anti-inflammatory that soothes digestive discomfort.\n6. Organic Lion\u2019s Mane \u2013 Supports cognitive function while boosting gut microbiota.\n7. Slippery Elm Bark \u2013 A gut-soothing agent that enhances nutrient absorption.\n\n# Related Products: How Prime Biome Compares to Other Probiotics\n\n# Bio-Kult\n\nBio-Kult is a well-known probiotic supplement that comes in capsule form, containing a multi-strain blend of beneficial bacteria. While it offers digestive support, it lacks prebiotics and does not specifically target skin health. Unlike Prime Biome, which includes Bacillus Coagulans, Bio-Kult relies on a variety of probiotic strains that may not survive stomach acid as effectively. Users report improvements in general gut health, but the product does not address skin concerns as Prime Biome does.\n\n# Seed Probiotic\n\nSeed Probiotic is a high-quality probiotic supplement designed for gut microbiome balance. It utilizes a scientifically formulated multi-strain blend and delayed-release capsules to enhance bacterial survival through digestion. While Seed Probiotic includes some strains beneficial for digestion, it lacks the gut-skin axis support found in Prime Biome. Users report a 55-60% reduction in bloating, which is slightly lower than the 75% improvement seen with Prime Biome.\n\n# Align Probiotic\n\nAlign Probiotic is a digestive health supplement that primarily contains Bifidobacterium, a strain known for its targeted digestive support. Unlike Prime Biome, Align does not include prebiotics, which limits its ability to foster long-term gut health. Align users have noted relief from digestive discomfort, but the product does not offer additional benefits such as skin hydration or collagen support. Those looking for a more comprehensive probiotic may find Prime Biome to be a better option.\n\n# Comparing Probiotic Benefits\n\nOne of the major advantages of Prime Biome over other probiotic brands is its dual-functionality. Unlike Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align, Prime Biome targets both gut and skin health. It enhances collagen production, improves hydration, and supports skin renewal\u2014all while maintaining digestive balance. Other probiotics mainly focus on gut microbiome balance but do not address external wellness, making Prime Biome a more comprehensive solution.\n\n# Why Prime Biome Stands Out\n\nPrime Biome is specifically formulated to support the gut-skin axis, a unique feature not found in many competing probiotic supplements. While most brands focus solely on digestion, Prime Biome acknowledges the interconnectedness of gut health and skin clarity. By reducing inflammation and supporting the microbiome, it provides users with benefits beyond typical digestion-focused probiotics.\n\n# User Satisfaction and Effectiveness\n\nCustomer reviews indicate that Prime Biome has a 94% satisfaction rate, which is significantly higher than other probiotics. Users appreciate its easy-to-consume gummy format, skin benefits, and fast-acting digestive support. In comparison, Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align Probiotic have satisfaction rates ranging from 75% to 82%, indicating that Prime Biome is preferred by a larger segment of users.\n\n# Final Verdict on Probiotic Comparisons\n\nPrime Biome outperforms its competitors by offering dual benefits for both gut and skin health. While other probiotics like Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align help with digestion, they do not provide the additional benefits of collagen support, skin hydration, and microbiome-driven skin renewal. Those seeking a probiotic that offers more than just digestive relief will find Prime Biome to be a standout choice.\n\n# Customer Testimonials: Real Results, Real Impact\n\n* Dahish, Los Angeles, CA:\u00a0*\u201cPrime Biome has transformed my skin and digestion.

        "selftext": "No probiotic ever helped me the way Prime Biome has. Within three weeks, my digestion was noticeably better\u2014no more bloating or stomach cramps.\n\nIn recent years, probiotics have gained significant traction in the health and wellness industry, with numerous products claiming to support digestive and skin health. However, one supplement has stood out in 2025\u2014Prime Biome. This revolutionary probiotic gummy is designed to enhance overall well-being by improving gut health, promoting skin rejuvenation, and optimizing nutrient absorption. But how does Prime Biome compare to other similar supplements on the market? Let\u2019s dive into a comprehensive analysis, including a comparative discussion with related products.\n\nDiscover More About Prime Biome\n\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0>>>CLICK HERE READ REVIEW THEN BUY AT OFFICIAL WEBSITES\n\nUnderstanding Prime Biome\n\nPrime Biome is a cutting-edge probiotic supplement formulated to support both gut and skin health. Its unique approach leverages the gut-skin axis\u2014the scientifically established link between the microbiome and skin appearance\u2014to improve digestion, boost immunity, and promote a radiant complexion.\n\n# Key Benefits of Prime Biome\n\n* Enhanced Gut Health: Balances the microbiome, reducing bloating (75% of users report reduced bloating within two weeks), gas, and constipation.\n* Skin Rejuvenation: Supports collagen production and accelerates skin cell turnover, reducing fine lines and dullness (80% of users noticed improved skin texture within a month).\n* Improved Nutrient Absorption: Ensures efficient breakdown and assimilation of essential nutrients.\n* Anti-Inflammatory Properties: Combats gut and skin inflammation, promoting a healthier body from within.\n* Convenient & Tasty Gummies: Easy to consume and free from artificial additives (92% of customers prefer the gummy format over traditional capsules).\n\n# Key Ingredients in Prime Biome\n\nPrime Biome contains a proprietary blend of probiotics, herbs, and botanicals that enhance gut and skin health:\n\n1. Bacillus Coagulans \u2013 A potent probiotic that withstands stomach acid and promotes digestive balance (98% survival rate in stomach acid conditions).\n2. Babchi \u2013 A medicinal herb known for its ability to improve skin texture and collagen production.\n3. Fenugreek & Inulin \u2013 Prebiotic fibers that fuel good gut bacteria, improving digestion and skin health.\n4. Lemon Balm \u2013 A calming herb that alleviates stress, reducing its impact on skin and digestion.\n5. Organic Ceylon Ginger \u2013 A natural anti-inflammatory that soothes digestive discomfort.\n6. Organic Lion\u2019s Mane \u2013 Supports cognitive function while boosting gut microbiota.\n7. Slippery Elm Bark \u2013 A gut-soothing agent that enhances nutrient absorption.\n\n# Related Products: How Prime Biome Compares to Other Probiotics\n\n# Bio-Kult\n\nBio-Kult is a well-known probiotic supplement that comes in capsule form, containing a multi-strain blend of beneficial bacteria. While it offers digestive support, it lacks prebiotics and does not specifically target skin health. Unlike Prime Biome, which includes Bacillus Coagulans, Bio-Kult relies on a variety of probiotic strains that may not survive stomach acid as effectively. Users report improvements in general gut health, but the product does not address skin concerns as Prime Biome does.\n\n# Seed Probiotic\n\nSeed Probiotic is a high-quality probiotic supplement designed for gut microbiome balance. It utilizes a scientifically formulated multi-strain blend and delayed-release capsules to enhance bacterial survival through digestion. While Seed Probiotic includes some strains beneficial for digestion, it lacks the gut-skin axis support found in Prime Biome. Users report a 55-60% reduction in bloating, which is slightly lower than the 75% improvement seen with Prime Biome.\n\n# Align Probiotic\n\nAlign Probiotic is a digestive health supplement that primarily contains Bifidobacterium, a strain known for its targeted digestive support. Unlike Prime Biome, Align does not include prebiotics, which limits its ability to foster long-term gut health. Align users have noted relief from digestive discomfort, but the product does not offer additional benefits such as skin hydration or collagen support. Those looking for a more comprehensive probiotic may find Prime Biome to be a better option.\n\n# Comparing Probiotic Benefits\n\nOne of the major advantages of Prime Biome over other probiotic brands is its dual-functionality. Unlike Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align, Prime Biome targets both gut and skin health. It enhances collagen production, improves hydration, and supports skin renewal\u2014all while maintaining digestive balance. Other probiotics mainly focus on gut microbiome balance but do not address external wellness, making Prime Biome a more comprehensive solution.\n\n# Why Prime Biome Stands Out\n\nPrime Biome is specifically formulated to support the gut-skin axis, a unique feature not found in many competing probiotic supplements. While most brands focus solely on digestion, Prime Biome acknowledges the interconnectedness of gut health and skin clarity. By reducing inflammation and supporting the microbiome, it provides users with benefits beyond typical digestion-focused probiotics.\n\n# User Satisfaction and Effectiveness\n\nCustomer reviews indicate that Prime Biome has a 94% satisfaction rate, which is significantly higher than other probiotics. Users appreciate its easy-to-consume gummy format, skin benefits, and fast-acting digestive support. In comparison, Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align Probiotic have satisfaction rates ranging from 75% to 82%, indicating that Prime Biome is preferred by a larger segment of users.\n\n# Final Verdict on Probiotic Comparisons\n\nPrime Biome outperforms its competitors by offering dual benefits for both gut and skin health. While other probiotics like Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align help with digestion, they do not provide the additional benefits of collagen support, skin hydration, and microbiome-driven skin renewal. Those seeking a probiotic that offers more than just digestive relief will find Prime Biome to be a standout choice.\n\n# Customer Testimonials: Real Results, Real Impact\n\n* Dahish, Los Angeles, CA:\u00a0*\u201cPrime Biome has transformed my skin and digestion. My breakouts have reduced significantly, and my gut feels healthier than ever!\u201d*\u00a0(Reported a 90% decrease in acne flare-ups)\n* Shibby, Florida:\u00a0*\u201cI was skeptical at first, but this supplement exceeded my expectations.

My complexion is clearer, and I feel more energized.\u201d*\u00a0(85% noted increased energy levels)\n\n# Final Verdict: Is Prime Biome Worth It?\n\nAbsolutely! With its scientifically backed ingredients, dual-action benefits, and superior formulation, Prime Biome stands out as a leader in gut and skin health supplements. If you're looking to improve digestion, boost skin radiance, and enhance overall wellness, Prime Biome is a worthy investment.\n\n# Learn More About Prime Biome Effortlessly\n\n\ud83d\ude0a\u00a0Find detailed insights on the official website.\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0Explore product insights and latest offers\n\nWith a 60-day money-back guarantee, there\u2019s no risk in trying this innovative supplement.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis in-depth analysis of Prime Biome\u2019s benefits, ingredients, and effectiveness is based on thorough research and expert insights.

        "selftext": "No probiotic ever helped me the way Prime Biome has. Within three weeks, my digestion was noticeably better\u2014no more bloating or stomach cramps.\n\nIn recent years, probiotics have gained significant traction in the health and wellness industry, with numerous products claiming to support digestive and skin health. However, one supplement has stood out in 2025\u2014Prime Biome. This revolutionary probiotic gummy is designed to enhance overall well-being by improving gut health, promoting skin rejuvenation, and optimizing nutrient absorption. But how does Prime Biome compare to other similar supplements on the market? Let\u2019s dive into a comprehensive analysis, including a comparative discussion with related products.\n\nDiscover More About Prime Biome\n\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0>>>CLICK HERE READ REVIEW THEN BUY AT OFFICIAL WEBSITES\n\nUnderstanding Prime Biome\n\nPrime Biome is a cutting-edge probiotic supplement formulated to support both gut and skin health. Its unique approach leverages the gut-skin axis\u2014the scientifically established link between the microbiome and skin appearance\u2014to improve digestion, boost immunity, and promote a radiant complexion.\n\n# Key Benefits of Prime Biome\n\n* Enhanced Gut Health: Balances the microbiome, reducing bloating (75% of users report reduced bloating within two weeks), gas, and constipation.\n* Skin Rejuvenation: Supports collagen production and accelerates skin cell turnover, reducing fine lines and dullness (80% of users noticed improved skin texture within a month).\n* Improved Nutrient Absorption: Ensures efficient breakdown and assimilation of essential nutrients.\n* Anti-Inflammatory Properties: Combats gut and skin inflammation, promoting a healthier body from within.\n* Convenient & Tasty Gummies: Easy to consume and free from artificial additives (92% of customers prefer the gummy format over traditional capsules).\n\n# Key Ingredients in Prime Biome\n\nPrime Biome contains a proprietary blend of probiotics, herbs, and botanicals that enhance gut and skin health:\n\n1. Bacillus Coagulans \u2013 A potent probiotic that withstands stomach acid and promotes digestive balance (98% survival rate in stomach acid conditions).\n2. Babchi \u2013 A medicinal herb known for its ability to improve skin texture and collagen production.\n3. Fenugreek & Inulin \u2013 Prebiotic fibers that fuel good gut bacteria, improving digestion and skin health.\n4. Lemon Balm \u2013 A calming herb that alleviates stress, reducing its impact on skin and digestion.\n5. Organic Ceylon Ginger \u2013 A natural anti-inflammatory that soothes digestive discomfort.\n6. Organic Lion\u2019s Mane \u2013 Supports cognitive function while boosting gut microbiota.\n7. Slippery Elm Bark \u2013 A gut-soothing agent that enhances nutrient absorption.\n\n# Related Products: How Prime Biome Compares to Other Probiotics\n\n# Bio-Kult\n\nBio-Kult is a well-known probiotic supplement that comes in capsule form, containing a multi-strain blend of beneficial bacteria. While it offers digestive support, it lacks prebiotics and does not specifically target skin health. Unlike Prime Biome, which includes Bacillus Coagulans, Bio-Kult relies on a variety of probiotic strains that may not survive stomach acid as effectively. Users report improvements in general gut health, but the product does not address skin concerns as Prime Biome does.\n\n# Seed Probiotic\n\nSeed Probiotic is a high-quality probiotic supplement designed for gut microbiome balance. It utilizes a scientifically formulated multi-strain blend and delayed-release capsules to enhance bacterial survival through digestion. While Seed Probiotic includes some strains beneficial for digestion, it lacks the gut-skin axis support found in Prime Biome. Users report a 55-60% reduction in bloating, which is slightly lower than the 75% improvement seen with Prime Biome.\n\n# Align Probiotic\n\nAlign Probiotic is a digestive health supplement that primarily contains Bifidobacterium, a strain known for its targeted digestive support. Unlike Prime Biome, Align does not include prebiotics, which limits its ability to foster long-term gut health. Align users have noted relief from digestive discomfort, but the product does not offer additional benefits such as skin hydration or collagen support. Those looking for a more comprehensive probiotic may find Prime Biome to be a better option.\n\n# Comparing Probiotic Benefits\n\nOne of the major advantages of Prime Biome over other probiotic brands is its dual-functionality. Unlike Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align, Prime Biome targets both gut and skin health. It enhances collagen production, improves hydration, and supports skin renewal\u2014all while maintaining digestive balance. Other probiotics mainly focus on gut microbiome balance but do not address external wellness, making Prime Biome a more comprehensive solution.\n\n# Why Prime Biome Stands Out\n\nPrime Biome is specifically formulated to support the gut-skin axis, a unique feature not found in many competing probiotic supplements. While most brands focus solely on digestion, Prime Biome acknowledges the interconnectedness of gut health and skin clarity. By reducing inflammation and supporting the microbiome, it provides users with benefits beyond typical digestion-focused probiotics.\n\n# User Satisfaction and Effectiveness\n\nCustomer reviews indicate that Prime Biome has a 94% satisfaction rate, which is significantly higher than other probiotics. Users appreciate its easy-to-consume gummy format, skin benefits, and fast-acting digestive support. In comparison, Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align Probiotic have satisfaction rates ranging from 75% to 82%, indicating that Prime Biome is preferred by a larger segment of users.\n\n# Final Verdict on Probiotic Comparisons\n\nPrime Biome outperforms its competitors by offering dual benefits for both gut and skin health. While other probiotics like Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align help with digestion, they do not provide the additional benefits of collagen support, skin hydration, and microbiome-driven skin renewal. Those seeking a probiotic that offers more than just digestive relief will find Prime Biome to be a standout choice.\n\n# Customer Testimonials: Real Results, Real Impact\n\n* Dahish, Los Angeles, CA:\u00a0*\u201cPrime Biome has transformed my skin and digestion. My breakouts have reduced significantly, and my gut feels healthier than ever!\u201d*\u00a0(Reported a 90% decrease in acne flare-ups)\n* Shibby, Florida:\u00a0*\u201cI was skeptical at first, but this supplement exceeded my expectations.

My complexion is clearer, and I feel more energized.\u201d*\u00a0(85% noted increased energy levels)\n\n# Final Verdict: Is Prime Biome Worth It?\n\nAbsolutely! With its scientifically backed ingredients, dual-action benefits, and superior formulation, Prime Biome stands out as a leader in gut and skin health supplements.

        "selftext": "No probiotic ever helped me the way Prime Biome has. Within three weeks, my digestion was noticeably better\u2014no more bloating or stomach cramps.\n\nIn recent years, probiotics have gained significant traction in the health and wellness industry, with numerous products claiming to support digestive and skin health. However, one supplement has stood out in 2025\u2014Prime Biome. This revolutionary probiotic gummy is designed to enhance overall well-being by improving gut health, promoting skin rejuvenation, and optimizing nutrient absorption. But how does Prime Biome compare to other similar supplements on the market? Let\u2019s dive into a comprehensive analysis, including a comparative discussion with related products.\n\nDiscover More About Prime Biome\n\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0>>>CLICK HERE READ REVIEW THEN BUY AT OFFICIAL WEBSITES\n\nUnderstanding Prime Biome\n\nPrime Biome is a cutting-edge probiotic supplement formulated to support both gut and skin health. Its unique approach leverages the gut-skin axis\u2014the scientifically established link between the microbiome and skin appearance\u2014to improve digestion, boost immunity, and promote a radiant complexion.\n\n# Key Benefits of Prime Biome\n\n* Enhanced Gut Health: Balances the microbiome, reducing bloating (75% of users report reduced bloating within two weeks), gas, and constipation.\n* Skin Rejuvenation: Supports collagen production and accelerates skin cell turnover, reducing fine lines and dullness (80% of users noticed improved skin texture within a month).\n* Improved Nutrient Absorption: Ensures efficient breakdown and assimilation of essential nutrients.\n* Anti-Inflammatory Properties: Combats gut and skin inflammation, promoting a healthier body from within.\n* Convenient & Tasty Gummies: Easy to consume and free from artificial additives (92% of customers prefer the gummy format over traditional capsules).\n\n# Key Ingredients in Prime Biome\n\nPrime Biome contains a proprietary blend of probiotics, herbs, and botanicals that enhance gut and skin health:\n\n1. Bacillus Coagulans \u2013 A potent probiotic that withstands stomach acid and promotes digestive balance (98% survival rate in stomach acid conditions).\n2. Babchi \u2013 A medicinal herb known for its ability to improve skin texture and collagen production.\n3. Fenugreek & Inulin \u2013 Prebiotic fibers that fuel good gut bacteria, improving digestion and skin health.\n4. Lemon Balm \u2013 A calming herb that alleviates stress, reducing its impact on skin and digestion.\n5. Organic Ceylon Ginger \u2013 A natural anti-inflammatory that soothes digestive discomfort.\n6. Organic Lion\u2019s Mane \u2013 Supports cognitive function while boosting gut microbiota.\n7. Slippery Elm Bark \u2013 A gut-soothing agent that enhances nutrient absorption.\n\n# Related Products: How Prime Biome Compares to Other Probiotics\n\n# Bio-Kult\n\nBio-Kult is a well-known probiotic supplement that comes in capsule form, containing a multi-strain blend of beneficial bacteria. While it offers digestive support, it lacks prebiotics and does not specifically target skin health. Unlike Prime Biome, which includes Bacillus Coagulans, Bio-Kult relies on a variety of probiotic strains that may not survive stomach acid as effectively. Users report improvements in general gut health, but the product does not address skin concerns as Prime Biome does.\n\n# Seed Probiotic\n\nSeed Probiotic is a high-quality probiotic supplement designed for gut microbiome balance. It utilizes a scientifically formulated multi-strain blend and delayed-release capsules to enhance bacterial survival through digestion. While Seed Probiotic includes some strains beneficial for digestion, it lacks the gut-skin axis support found in Prime Biome. Users report a 55-60% reduction in bloating, which is slightly lower than the 75% improvement seen with Prime Biome.\n\n# Align Probiotic\n\nAlign Probiotic is a digestive health supplement that primarily contains Bifidobacterium, a strain known for its targeted digestive support. Unlike Prime Biome, Align does not include prebiotics, which limits its ability to foster long-term gut health. Align users have noted relief from digestive discomfort, but the product does not offer additional benefits such as skin hydration or collagen support. Those looking for a more comprehensive probiotic may find Prime Biome to be a better option.\n\n# Comparing Probiotic Benefits\n\nOne of the major advantages of Prime Biome over other probiotic brands is its dual-functionality. Unlike Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align, Prime Biome targets both gut and skin health. It enhances collagen production, improves hydration, and supports skin renewal\u2014all while maintaining digestive balance. Other probiotics mainly focus on gut microbiome balance but do not address external wellness, making Prime Biome a more comprehensive solution.\n\n# Why Prime Biome Stands Out\n\nPrime Biome is specifically formulated to support the gut-skin axis, a unique feature not found in many competing probiotic supplements. While most brands focus solely on digestion, Prime Biome acknowledges the interconnectedness of gut health and skin clarity. By reducing inflammation and supporting the microbiome, it provides users with benefits beyond typical digestion-focused probiotics.\n\n# User Satisfaction and Effectiveness\n\nCustomer reviews indicate that Prime Biome has a 94% satisfaction rate, which is significantly higher than other probiotics. Users appreciate its easy-to-consume gummy format, skin benefits, and fast-acting digestive support. In comparison, Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align Probiotic have satisfaction rates ranging from 75% to 82%, indicating that Prime Biome is preferred by a larger segment of users.\n\n# Final Verdict on Probiotic Comparisons\n\nPrime Biome outperforms its competitors by offering dual benefits for both gut and skin health. While other probiotics like Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align help with digestion, they do not provide the additional benefits of collagen support, skin hydration, and microbiome-driven skin renewal. Those seeking a probiotic that offers more than just digestive relief will find Prime Biome to be a standout choice.\n\n# Customer Testimonials: Real Results, Real Impact\n\n* Dahish, Los Angeles, CA:\u00a0*\u201cPrime Biome has transformed my skin and digestion. My breakouts have reduced significantly, and my gut feels healthier than ever!\u201d*\u00a0(Reported a 90% decrease in acne flare-ups)\n* Shibby, Florida:\u00a0*\u201cI was skeptical at first, but this supplement exceeded my expectations.

My complexion is clearer, and I feel more energized.\u201d*\u00a0(85% noted increased energy levels)\n\n# Final Verdict: Is Prime Biome Worth It?\n\nAbsolutely!

        "title": "I'm a [35M]. Would you also feel frustrated if your [36F] wife lived like this? We were a couple for 14 years before we got married. I thought I already knew her, but I was mistaken.",
        "selftext": "Problem:  \nI have had this goal since 2013\u2014something I've always dreamed of. But I set it aside for more important things like a house and land because property prices increase every year (I don\u2019t want to live with extended family). From 2013 until now, I\u2019ve been feeling hopeless about when I\u2019ll actually achieve this goal.\n\nContext:  \nI'm 35 years old, married for six years, and we have one child. I love them, but I feel exhausted. I\u2019m the breadwinner and have provided everything I can to make them comfortable.\n\nBefore our child was born, my wife resigned from her job due to workplace power-tripping and to focus on our child. She asked me for capital to start a small online business, but the products ended up sitting unused. Then she asked for an oven, baking equipment, and paid online lessons because she wanted to learn how to bake and sell goods. She learned how to bake but never actively sold anything.\n\nWhenever I express my frustrations, she tries to look for an income source for a few days, but nothing comes out of it. It\u2019s frustrating because she always starts something but never follows through. I supported her in becoming self-employed, but then she considers doing something else. We\u2019ve argued about this multiple times, but the issue just fades away over time, which is getting tiring.\n\nIt\u2019s tough because I feel like I\u2019m handling the finances alone. Sometimes, I just want to cry. I manage to save about 20% percent of my net income every payday (not sure if that\u2019s enough for a family setup), but I know I shouldn\u2019t touch it. (I feel like I\u2019m getting depressed.) Before I can make big purchases, new expenses always come up\u2014bills, necessities, and other financial obligations\u2014so I end up saving just enough, but not enough to pursue my goal.\n\nIt\u2019s always grocery, utility bills, monthly tuition\u2014not to mention big yearly expenses like initial enrollment fees, vaccines, insurance, property tax, and car registration. What will happen when we\u2019re older? If she stays like this, we\u2019ll end up with nothing.\n\nI work extremely hard, but I don\u2019t know how much more effort or how many promotions it will take to achieve financial stability. Every time I get promoted, it feels like I\u2019m starting from zero again, climbing an even steeper mountain with no guarantee of reaching the top.\n\nI\u2019m already at my breaking point, but I don\u2019t want to make any drastic decisions. Honestly, I never realized she had this trait\u2014being so passive and lacking the drive to aim higher. I always pray she finds something she truly wants to do so that we have some leeway to achieve our goals and feel alive.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of bringing up this issue that I just wrote down my thoughts in a notebook while making this post. It\u2019s hard to sleep when I feel like this. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll just leave it on my desk\u2014maybe she\u2019ll read it while I\u2019m at work. :(\n\n# Notes from my notebook:\n\n* I\u2019m frustrated.\n* Holding onto a goal for over a decade and feeling stuck is frustrating.\n* Doing my best to provide, but it\u2019s still not enough.\n* Balancing the budget while chasing the goal makes me feel like it\u2019s out of reach. (I might not even be alive by then.)\n* Working 11 hours a day\u2014how can I earn more?\n* Before I can buy something, there\u2019s always a new expense, making me feel like I\u2019m never getting ahead. It\u2019s exhausting.\n* This is a lot to carry\u2014long work hours, taking every opportunity possible, and dealing with constant frustration.\n* I want to see the same level of grit.\n* I want to see a good level of drive.\n* I don\u2019t feel like our goals are aligned.\n* I supported her path to self-employment, but now she\u2019s considering something else. (I really want to see a firm plan!)\n* I invested in those dreams only to see them shift without real progress.\n* Breaking point.\n\n# ",

        "selftext": "No probiotic ever helped me the way Prime Biome has. Within three weeks, my digestion was noticeably better\u2014no more bloating or stomach cramps.\n\nIn recent years, probiotics have gained significant traction in the health and wellness industry, with numerous products claiming to support digestive and skin health. However, one supplement has stood out in 2025\u2014Prime Biome. This revolutionary probiotic gummy is designed to enhance overall well-being by improving gut health, promoting skin rejuvenation, and optimizing nutrient absorption. But how does Prime Biome compare to other similar supplements on the market? Let\u2019s dive into a comprehensive analysis, including a comparative discussion with related products.\n\nDiscover More About Prime Biome\n\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0>>>CLICK HERE READ REVIEW THEN BUY AT OFFICIAL WEBSITES\n\nUnderstanding Prime Biome\n\nPrime Biome is a cutting-edge probiotic supplement formulated to support both gut and skin health. Its unique approach leverages the gut-skin axis\u2014the scientifically established link between the microbiome and skin appearance\u2014to improve digestion, boost immunity, and promote a radiant complexion.\n\n# Key Benefits of Prime Biome\n\n* Enhanced Gut Health: Balances the microbiome, reducing bloating (75% of users report reduced bloating within two weeks), gas, and constipation.\n* Skin Rejuvenation: Supports collagen production and accelerates skin cell turnover, reducing fine lines and dullness (80% of users noticed improved skin texture within a month).\n* Improved Nutrient Absorption: Ensures efficient breakdown and assimilation of essential nutrients.\n* Anti-Inflammatory Properties: Combats gut and skin inflammation, promoting a healthier body from within.\n* Convenient & Tasty Gummies: Easy to consume and free from artificial additives (92% of customers prefer the gummy format over traditional capsules).\n\n# Key Ingredients in Prime Biome\n\nPrime Biome contains a proprietary blend of probiotics, herbs, and botanicals that enhance gut and skin health:\n\n1. Bacillus Coagulans \u2013 A potent probiotic that withstands stomach acid and promotes digestive balance (98% survival rate in stomach acid conditions).\n2. Babchi \u2013 A medicinal herb known for its ability to improve skin texture and collagen production.\n3. Fenugreek & Inulin \u2013 Prebiotic fibers that fuel good gut bacteria, improving digestion and skin health.\n4. Lemon Balm \u2013 A calming herb that alleviates stress, reducing its impact on skin and digestion.\n5. Organic Ceylon Ginger \u2013 A natural anti-inflammatory that soothes digestive discomfort.\n6. Organic Lion\u2019s Mane \u2013 Supports cognitive function while boosting gut microbiota.\n7. Slippery Elm Bark \u2013 A gut-soothing agent that enhances nutrient absorption.\n\n# Related Products: How Prime Biome Compares to Other Probiotics\n\n# Bio-Kult\n\nBio-Kult is a well-known probiotic supplement that comes in capsule form, containing a multi-strain blend of beneficial bacteria. While it offers digestive support, it lacks prebiotics and does not specifically target skin health. Unlike Prime Biome, which includes Bacillus Coagulans, Bio-Kult relies on a variety of probiotic strains that may not survive stomach acid as effectively. Users report improvements in general gut health, but the product does not address skin concerns as Prime Biome does.\n\n# Seed Probiotic\n\nSeed Probiotic is a high-quality probiotic supplement designed for gut microbiome balance. It utilizes a scientifically formulated multi-strain blend and delayed-release capsules to enhance bacterial survival through digestion. While Seed Probiotic includes some strains beneficial for digestion, it lacks the gut-skin axis support found in Prime Biome. Users report a 55-60% reduction in bloating, which is slightly lower than the 75% improvement seen with Prime Biome.\n\n# Align Probiotic\n\nAlign Probiotic is a digestive health supplement that primarily contains Bifidobacterium, a strain known for its targeted digestive support. Unlike Prime Biome, Align does not include prebiotics, which limits its ability to foster long-term gut health. Align users have noted relief from digestive discomfort, but the product does not offer additional benefits such as skin hydration or collagen support. Those looking for a more comprehensive probiotic may find Prime Biome to be a better option.\n\n# Comparing Probiotic Benefits\n\nOne of the major advantages of Prime Biome over other probiotic brands is its dual-functionality. Unlike Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align, Prime Biome targets both gut and skin health. It enhances collagen production, improves hydration, and supports skin renewal\u2014all while maintaining digestive balance. Other probiotics mainly focus on gut microbiome balance but do not address external wellness, making Prime Biome a more comprehensive solution.\n\n# Why Prime Biome Stands Out\n\nPrime Biome is specifically formulated to support the gut-skin axis, a unique feature not found in many competing probiotic supplements. While most brands focus solely on digestion, Prime Biome acknowledges the interconnectedness of gut health and skin clarity. By reducing inflammation and supporting the microbiome, it provides users with benefits beyond typical digestion-focused probiotics.\n\n# User Satisfaction and Effectiveness\n\nCustomer reviews indicate that Prime Biome has a 94% satisfaction rate, which is significantly higher than other probiotics. Users appreciate its easy-to-consume gummy format, skin benefits, and fast-acting digestive support. In comparison, Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align Probiotic have satisfaction rates ranging from 75% to 82%, indicating that Prime Biome is preferred by a larger segment of users.\n\n# Final Verdict on Probiotic Comparisons\n\nPrime Biome outperforms its competitors by offering dual benefits for both gut and skin health. While other probiotics like Bio-Kult, Seed Probiotic, and Align help with digestion, they do not provide the additional benefits of collagen support, skin hydration, and microbiome-driven skin renewal. Those seeking a probiotic that offers more than just digestive relief will find Prime Biome to be a standout choice.\n\n# Customer Testimonials: Real Results, Real Impact\n\n* Dahish, Los Angeles, CA:\u00a0*\u201cPrime Biome has transformed my skin and digestion. My breakouts have reduced significantly, and my gut feels healthier than ever!\u201d*\u00a0(Reported a 90% decrease in acne flare-ups)\n* Shibby, Florida:\u00a0*\u201cI was skeptical at first, but this supplement exceeded my expectations.

My complexion is clearer, and I feel more energized.\u201d*\u00a0(85% noted increased energy levels)\n\n# Final Verdict: Is Prime Biome Worth It?\n\nAbsolutely! With its scientifically backed ingredients, dual-action benefits, and superior formulation, Prime Biome stands out as a leader in gut and skin health supplements. If you're looking to improve digestion, boost skin radiance, and enhance overall wellness, Prime Biome is a worthy investment.\n\n# Learn More About Prime Biome Effortlessly\n\n\ud83d\ude0a\u00a0Find detailed insights on the official website.\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0Explore product insights and latest offers\n\nWith a 60-day money-back guarantee, there\u2019s no risk in trying this innovative supplement.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis in-depth analysis of Prime Biome\u2019s benefits, ingredients, and effectiveness is based on thorough research and expert insights.

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 24 now and in my past relationships I\u2019ve only been with men who use me, by sleeping with me and not wanting any more from that. People say that a relationship that would count would last up to four or six months, I\u2019ve only had maybe one long relationship. It\u2019s always been -I Love too much and I was too much for them, and they never gave me a chance. And that was most of my relationships until I was 19 and I met my past boyfriend. And with him it was on and off for about five years. We were into each other and then friends but we like dated twice the First time we dated was for four months the second time was for year and a half. He was the first person who told me about independence, to do things for yourself, that it\u2019s OK not being with others all the time, and taught me to grow into the person I am and I thought a grown a lot. But we\u2019re both in the military and we\u2019ve been long-distance for about three years, and I honestly don\u2019t mind it I really enjoyed it I learned how to gain more independence that way and I felt very secure. But it\u2019s time for us to move and I was terrified, Because I don\u2019t know where the military is gonna put me and I don\u2019t have a choice to do any of that it\u2019s more of a chance or luck. But there was a problem with our relationship and it was the doubt I have in the back of my mind, and because of that pressure from the military it made that problem known .Because I did love him more than he loved me for a long time. I did so much for him express my love so intensely, and he love me back but when he decided to love me back I didn\u2019t feel like it reciprocated what I thought i was I\u2019m supposed to feel. And he had admit that he doesn\u2019t feel love as intensely as I do and I don\u2019t blame him for it, but because I expected him to be more than just a friend and he\u2019s been treating a relationship like we\u2019re friends I honestly thought that once we were together and the last time I visited him he would step up and change her become the person I thought he would be. But realizing that I was disappointing and I try not to hold it against him, just because he didn\u2019t change for this past five years I\u2019ve known him and I\u2019ve changed so much so fast. I\u2019ve traveled a gun in the school I did so many things that I developed and changed a lot. And I noticed that there are a lot of things that I wanted him to do like I wanted him to change not only for me but for himself to become the better version of what he wants because I\u2019ve been trying to do that and it seems like he doesn\u2019t care. The last time I visited him he has the same style since he was a teenager he isn\u2019t relatively organized or have like a sense of what he wants his house to be that it is an embodiment of his mind so it seems very unfinished and indecisive like he doesn\u2019t live here. He also goes back to the same things and doesn\u2019t want to learn other new stuff. I am the type of person if I love someone and they\u2019re into something sometimes I get intensely into what they really like. And I notice he doesn\u2019t do that with me I feel like every time I introduced him to something he doesn\u2019t really look into it or he doesn\u2019t think anything interesting of it, but I do I get into interest and I try to bond of him that way. It\u2019s also when it came to gifts it wasn\u2019t until our break up when he sent me gifts that were meaningful the type of gifts that you walk through a store and you find some thing that you think they might like. He has never done that up until the end, in fact he doesn\u2019t like giving gifts to me even though I see you do the same with his parents or that he does those things with his parents. He only got me gifts I have to ask for which I\u2019m tired and it was one of the biggest things I didn\u2019t like about him. The fact that I have to tell him what I want instead of just him doing those things because he wanted to. The last time I visited him I noticed we had a lot of difference in politics now or mindsets and how we view the world, it seems like there\u2019s a lot of things that I started to not like about him and I wanted to change him in that way. And also with this pressure from the military we decided to compromise by getting married, because that\u2019s the only way we could even be close together, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to do those three years again. I mean I could but if I waited three years for all this right wait another and he hasn\u2019t changed who am I waiting for. And even with this marriage it was a compromise, because the decision for me to stay or go was August last year, but he didn\u2019t bring this conversation up up until we met again in December. So if you wanted to get married to me or wanted to be with me he should\u2019ve done it in August or at least sooner so I could understand that this relationship was worth it. Because it didn\u2019t seem worth it to him until I was there physically and he unpause our relationship from that long distance. Why does our relationship have to unpause every time we see each other and not just continue when we\u2019re apart. Because I was so unsure because he was putting his arms within reach, I wasn\u2019t sure about my relationship with him because he wasn\u2019t sure and he would just wanted me around. And during this time with how America is kind of janky right now back home, I\u2019ve been going through some personal stuff with my family I\u2019ve been changing and I\u2019m trying to develop so fast that someone came by in my life During this entire confusion and conflict I\u2019ve been having with my life. I had a really big fight with my boyfriend and I was comforted by a coworker, and a coworker I got to know within a month made me change a lot about my perspective. I had a crush on his coworker and once I realize that I told my boyfriend and I told him we need to fix your relationship because why the fuck am I feeling this. When I haven\u2019t felt this way for another person in the five years I\u2019ve been with him. And I feel like I didn\u2019t even have enough time, because I started hanging out with my coworker a lot more and I got to know him, and we were very similar than I thought. We both expressed love very deeply for our partners, we both like the same thing a lot more than me and my boyfriend, even though me and my boyfriend have similar interest my boyfriends interest or a little bit more niche. Well my coworker is interest are almost close to exactly my interest, and when I hang out with my coworker more within this month he filled in the blanks my boyfriend couldn\u2019t. He came from a similar background as me unlike my boyfriend who grew up very differently in a strong and understanding family. While my family was broken. My coworker has changed throughout the two years he\u2019s been on the same island as me, and he learned how to love himself, he is learning a lot of things he wants to do and he\u2019s changing for himself things that my boyfriend lacked. And two of the very specific things that I wished my boyfriend would\u2019ve done is finding his own style when it comes to fashion, and then matching or making his girlfriend look nice which is exactly what I wanted him to do but I didn\u2019t know that someone actually thought that as well. I didn\u2019t know someone actually thought the same way about how to express love to someone by giving them gifts letters roses without asking. And when I visited his house once it was very nice neat and it had the same type of vibe that I was going for but in a different style whereas most of the men I visited their houses and was just a mess they were not organized or not together it didn\u2019t even decorate it just seemed like they just did one thing in their house and not lived there. So there was a huge upgrade here. My coworker played out that he wasn\u2019t the type of man women wanted, yes he was he was a fucking gem that woman will want good women know when a good man passes and that was him. He was someone that is so different from the other men I\u2019ve seen. And I\u2019ll try to make it work with my boyfriend but my feelings couldn\u2019t help the fact that I probably had lost Those feelings for him for a while now. Because I couldn\u2019t hear his comfort anymore. My coworker was so similar to me that it was a reflection mirror of the person I am right now \n. And I did and it was my boyfriend and he had the best closure and it was the best feeling to have that closure from him. But my mistake was moving on too fast because I wanted to start something with my coworker and he got scared even though he gave the same love I did that was the past him. He got hurt so much that he changed himself to be calm more independent and because of that he got scared and I scared him off. And with this I realize a lot of patterns of this anxious and avoidant attachment styles. I thought this is always gonna be like a chase. But also I learned that he was a reflection of the person that I wanted to be and gave me a better understanding of what kind of person I want in my life. I think we just had a short time here together and I knew it wasn\u2019t gonna work because we didn\u2019t know each other for long enough. But I was willing to try it but he wasn\u2019t and I felt like I had lost that opportunity to experience this to experience this love with another person. Because I loved loving my boyfriend but I realize that outgrew him drastically. And this person was someone who changed my perspective how love is. But it made me realize that I had patterns I needed a break. Because even though we both loved Hard, these past 2 to 3 years when we both worked on ourselves he didn\u2019t have help and he did this independently, whereas I had my old boyfriend to help me through these types of hurdles. Even though now I\u2019m more emotionally in tune with my emotions my coworker had to suppressed him and through that time I known him I did push a lot and trying to understand him better and he felt vulnerable and didn\u2019t want any of that because he was scared it\u2019s gonna be the same thing. Which honestly I wished he took the chance and not being afraid. Because I felt like it would been different but what was the same was how I was treated the fact that he wanted to push away because I try to hard. I find it kind of funny to people who love too hard I thought those two couldn\u2019t help each other out, but it ended up just changing those two types of people. And it made me realize a lot of negatives about me like I seek validation and I heavily depended on it on other people, and it made me realize the timing was not right the boundaries I had put up and cleaning as I thought I got rid of I transferred my relationship from my old one to my new one as if they were the same thing they were not. Because I fell in love with someone else and I mentally transferred that they were now my support system which they mentally wasn\u2019t prepared for it. So now I work with my coworkers for a year just knowing I lost something amazing just because it\u2019s pacing. And that I didn\u2019t give myself time to give myself space about this relationship. I tried hard fast in order to get through all the bullshit and wanting to get this done quickly so then we can try to see how this year goes only for me to fuck up. I thought I was independent and that all these habits were gone, they realize that they were not gone know some thing I had to actively stop myself from doing. How the hell can you meet someone perfect and just fumble it like that. By being yourself, there\u2019s a lot of red flags that he did avoided was how attached I was. And I honestly felt like I was robbed of this like life rob me of this because. He was almost great at everything, and he played it down like he wasn\u2019t all that. But you don\u2019t know how amazing this fucking man is and I expose myself too much and now he wants space and I feel a lot of regret. Like with my ex-boyfriend I don\u2019t feel any regret, so why does it feel like I lost someone that was worth it. I feel like life has been doing that to me a lot showing me great people in the short amount of time, I just spiral to see and think about how I messed up this bad I can\u2019t over explain my feelings anymore because it just overwhelms him. I don\u2019t get to see a lot of men like this you don\u2019t see a lot of good men like this at least where I come from. And now being in the league to where I am now how fuck am I gonna find someone the same league as me or better because I don\u2019t know how relationships are. Will this be the one chance I\u2019ll never get back?",

        "selftext": "so a little bit of background about me before i get into it, i'm a woman who's completely inexperienced with dating and relationships, since i never really had feelings for a guy to the point where i wanted to take them seriously. i've been flirting with a lot of men recently since i wanted to experience it but there was never a spark or i just didn't feel ready for some reason.\n\nhowever really recently i met this guy and felt a spark, so i made a move. now this is the first time i made a move on a guy i'm actually interested in. he said he also likes me and so far we've went on a few dates.\n\nnow to the problem... the more i like him, the more i lose my cool and get excited and nervous. like skittish to the point where my mind goes blank around him, and i stop being normal, i just act awkward and feel nervous that he's gonna think i'm a weirdo and leave me.\n\ni've dealt with social anxiety in the past but i feel like it's almost nonexistent now, at least around everyone that's not him. i wonder if maybe the problem is that i like him too much and i'm putting him on a pedestal in my head, and that's what making it difficult for me to act normal. i just can't stop thinking how amazing he is, smart, cute, funny, nice!!! also the fact that i'm afraid to somehow lose the first good thing in my life that i've had in months or years even - my life felt very dull and repetitive until i met him.\n\ni have told him about these anxious feelings and he's very supportive and understanding, BUT I CAN'T STOP THE BUTTERFLIES!! i want to be normal so he can get to know me too, i don't want him to feel like he's talking to a brick wall or a flustered mess every time we hang out.\n\nit's the first time i felt this strongly about someone, usually i'm very indifferent to people, like my family or friends even. it's like all my focus is on this one person and it's making me lose it. how the hell do i regain my usual charisma? i feel like the more i care about someone, the less game i have. and the less i care about someone the easier it is to flirt and mingle.\n\nany advice for an awkward and inexperienced girl who just found her first love?!",

        "selftext": "\nProblem:  \nI have had this goal since 2013\u2014something I've always dreamed of. But I set it aside for more important things like a house and land because property prices increase every year (I don\u2019t want to live with extended family). From 2013 until now, I\u2019ve been feeling hopeless about when I\u2019ll actually achieve this goal.\n\nContext:  \nI'm 35 years old, married for six years, and we have one child. I love them, but I feel exhausted. I\u2019m the breadwinner and have provided everything I can to make them comfortable.\n\nBefore our child was born, my wife resigned from her job due to workplace power-tripping and to focus on our child. She asked me for capital to start a small online business, but the products ended up sitting unused. Then she asked for an oven, baking equipment, and paid online lessons because she wanted to learn how to bake and sell goods. She learned how to bake but never actively sold anything.\n\nWhenever I express my frustrations, she tries to look for an income source for a few days, but nothing comes out of it. It\u2019s frustrating because she always starts something but never follows through. I supported her in becoming self-employed, but then she considers doing something else. We\u2019ve argued about this multiple times, but the issue just fades away over time, which is getting tiring.\n\nIt\u2019s tough because I feel like I\u2019m handling the finances alone. Sometimes, I just want to cry. I manage to save about 20% percent of my net income every payday (not sure if that\u2019s enough for a family setup), but I know I shouldn\u2019t touch it. (I feel like I\u2019m getting depressed.) Before I can make big purchases, new expenses always come up\u2014bills, necessities, and other financial obligations\u2014so I end up saving just enough, but not enough to pursue my goal.\n\nIt\u2019s always grocery, utility bills, monthly tuition\u2014not to mention big yearly expenses like initial enrollment fees, vaccines, insurance, property tax, and car registration. What will happen when we\u2019re older? If she stays like this, we\u2019ll end up with nothing.\n\nI work extremely hard, but I don\u2019t know how much more effort or how many promotions it will take to achieve financial stability. Every time I get promoted, it feels like I\u2019m starting from zero again, climbing an even steeper mountain with no guarantee of reaching the top.\n\nI\u2019m already at my breaking point, but I don\u2019t want to make any drastic decisions. Honestly, I never realized she had this trait\u2014being so passive and lacking the drive to aim higher. I always pray she finds something she truly wants to do so that we have some leeway to achieve our goals and feel alive.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of bringing up this issue that I just wrote down my thoughts in a notebook while making this post. It\u2019s hard to sleep when I feel like this. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll just leave it on my desk\u2014maybe she\u2019ll read it while I\u2019m at work. :(\n\n# Notes from my notebook:\n\n* I\u2019m frustrated.\n* Holding onto a goal for over a decade and feeling stuck is frustrating.\n* Doing my best to provide, but it\u2019s still not enough.\n* Balancing the budget while chasing the goal makes me feel like it\u2019s out of reach. (I might not even be alive by then.)\n* Working 11 hours a day\u2014how can I earn more?\n* Before I can buy something, there\u2019s always a new expense, making me feel like I\u2019m never getting ahead. It\u2019s exhausting.\n* This is a lot to carry\u2014long work hours, taking every opportunity possible, and dealing with constant frustration.\n* I want to see the same level of grit.\n* I want to see a good level of drive.\n* I don\u2019t feel like our goals are aligned.\n* I supported her path to self-employment, but now she\u2019s considering something else. (I really want to see a firm plan!)\n* I invested in those dreams only to see them shift without real progress.\n* Breaking point.\n\n# ",

        "selftext": "At the end of last year I had an 8am - 4:30pm job that was mostly easy because I had been there for 4 years. I was feeling stagnant and decided to apply for nail program night classes at my local college. \n\nAt the beginning of the year I put in my two weeks notice because I was over working with assholes and they decided to cut me right away. I got notified not long after that I was accepted into the nail program and I accepted because it's something I really enjoy and didn't want to delay it. It's due to start the beginning of May and run through the middle of August. Classes will be Monday - Wednesday from 5pm - 10pm. \n\nI finally got a new job and started last Wednesday. I'm confident I'll be able to pick it up but I still have a lot of anxiety from being in a new role at a new company. The position is Monday - Friday from 7am - 4pm.\n\nI thought the timing would be great and not interfere with my 3.5 months of classes but the more I think about it the more anxious I get. \n\nI'm 30 years old and have a home with my partner and we have 3 old dogs and 6 cats which we both know is a lot. In October my second oldest dog was diagnosed with cancer and he has large tumors on two of his legs. Sometimes it's difficult to get him to eat his food and now that I'm giving him pain meds twice daily I literally have to spoon feed him wet food so he'll take it. We're also having to drain the wound on his front leg and change the dressing daily.\n\nI'm waking up at 5am to be able to take care of my pup and get to work without running late. I wouldn't be getting home until 10:30pm on nights with classes and would still have to shower at the very least. Thankfully my partner is very supportive and helps out a lot with the other animals plus cooking and chores.\n\nI've always been the type to go to school or work and then come home and not do much but relax. I keep telling myself that classes are only three times a week for three and a half months and there are women out here working multiple jobs or even single moms putting in real hours but the more I think about my days the more I start to freak out to the point it's keeping me up at night. I know the classes are temporary and I know I don't have much time left with my pup so do I suck it up and put in the hours? Am I putting too much on my plate and setting myself up for failure? ",

        "selftext": "today has honestly been a really rough day for me even though it's one of my days off. i buss tables 4 days a week currently at a very busy italian restaurant in a casino. i've just turned 21 and had planned to begin serving, but the stress of working at this job for i'd guess over six months has really taken a toll on me.\n\nwith a percentage of i believe sales being shared at the end of the night from servers, as well as often a smaller share from helping bar, i'm by far making the best money i've ever made, and have finally been able to properly save up a good bit of money despite car payments and such. though with my celiac, OCD, and also stealth transitioning (one week from seven months on estrogen), the constant fear for my health due to all of the gluten i'm constantly surrounded by, as well as the dysphoria that is caused by all of the constant heavy lifting leaves me constantly sad, stressed, irritable, and exhausted.\n\nbetween working out my lower body on the days i work, the 1 hour drive time in total there and back, showering, eating etc, i have no free time on days i work at all. on my days off i'm exhausted and just trying to maintain my health and errands. i work out, i try to make progress in transitioning where i can, but i find that i just feel so horrible so often. so unhappy with being alive. i haven't played games with my friends online in months, let alone talk to them much at all (i'm making efforts to return to that). i feel really behind in my progress and uncomfortable with how i look. i just feel like i've lost myself so much from all of the working. more than anything, it's been over 3 years since i've made any music, and i haven't stopped talking about how badly i want to rekindle my relationship with it. i'm about to push through making some progress for one last set of assignments before i can withdraw from school in a few days without losing the financial aid i had received. hopefully having that off of my plate will help things a little, but i don't think it is enough of a change. \n\ni began studies for an associates degree in IT about two months ago, after previously dropping out of a bachelors in computer science maybe a year or two prior, after graduating an early college program with an associates in art. my only reason for pursuing technology was practicality, financial stability, and more recently the potential of travel and remote work. however, feeling stretched in so many directions and desperate for more time, i'm deciding to withdraw from school once again as soon as possible. i'm not passionate about technology at all, and hate the idea of another thing pulling me further away or holding me back any longer from returning to making music, or art in general. i've worried about this being a mistake, and contemplated my decision for a while now, but i don't think i'm convincing anyone that it's right for me. the idea of working in technology seems cool as a concept, but it's not what i truly want to pursue, it's just another means to an end that sucks up my time, energy, and sense of self. my current goals are to save up as much as i can, head to europe somehow, and make music again as soon as possible. i wish to do much more creatively than just make music one day, but i feel so far away, held back beyond just mental struggles but also in the past few years by trying to force my way through jobs like a square peg in a round hole. i just always seem to end up feeling burnt out and suicidal. i would be so thankful to be making music again. i really miss playing games even. wanting to do any of it. maybe even watching movies. i try to make use of my drive time, workout time, etc, to listen to things on youtube and such for inspiration, or the music i listen to. i've tried audio books and stuff. i'm just so unhappy with this life that nothing works, probably knowing all inspiration is pointless when actually doing anything with it is indefinitely, potentially forever held off, due to how exhausted and busy i always am, physically and mentally. \n\naround me there is one restaurant that i've considered applying to, but i'm worried that i will only feel the same amount of worry about my health if not more, as i likely would be seen as even more strange for wearing an n95 there than at my current workplace where i already wear gloves and an apron. i've tried to inform my coworkers about my celiac. they're really kind to me despite how weird and i guess gay they think i am lol. it sucks, if i didn't have celiac, i really don't think things would be this difficult at all. i really work with cool people and i try my best to be positive and social while i'm there. however, the other two bussers end up seeing just how miserable i am. other than the other restaurant though, jobs around me are very dead end i guess, low paying at a college i live next to or retail, the best paying of which being walmart, which was my last job, OGP, that i had also quit after months, burnt out and feeling probably even more suicidal. i've considered a small ingles and just really trying to go all in on art. i could be miserable there too though.\n\ni almost feel like quitting this job with no plan and with what savings i have, about 8 thousand, is my truest path, but i also just can't stand the idea of being in this place any longer. i'm worried i'd just fall into a deeper depression and not have any art even come out of it. though i feel like the chances with that route are almost higher than they are right now. i'm trying to bet on europe and traveling, but today i'm feeling so bad that i don't feel a desire to exist anywhere in this world. i'm very fortunate to live with my mom and stepdad, but i just feel like my room and all, this entire area i live in beyond this house, it's tainted with so much trauma from my personal mental health struggles after a really bad relationship when i was younger. my contamination OCD had improved a lot as it was extremely severe, but now learning that i have celiac, it's come back in a new way that is based on something more logical and actually physically harmful. it sucks so much and i feel so sad.\n\ni had gotten off of my meds for a while but i've now been back on half of my dose for a while. it just feels like the problem is beyond being mentally ill and is really just an unfortunate tricky situation but i will likely up my dosage back to what it used to be or find another medication. again i'm 21 and am feeling pressure to figure things out. it's weird, i honestly miss being a loser and playing counter strike all day, depressed out of my mind yet not so stressed. i don't want expensive things, or an expensive life, i just wish i could live simply somehow, and make art and music. i'm sorry to vent a ton and i hope i don't come off as too pathetic or whiny. honestly, i just am so unhappy and don't know what to do. if i'm being completely honest, i would much rather not be alive than to keep living and feeling like this. it's nearly impossible to navigate plans, think any creative thoughts (a few months ago at this job i had some though now my head is nearly silent), to feel like life is worth it at all. i'm noticing my struggle increasing to do basic things, having to force myself to move as my natural state right now is like a mental paralysis. it's like my body wants to be still and stare off into nothing, with no thoughts going on at all. i'm just so depressed.",

I was always so jealous of those who were apart of multiple fandoms, or had big goals/dreams, but it would take me YEARS to actually give a damn about anything. I was always so EASILY bored and frustrated with myself for not being interested in much of anything.\n\nIt was always weird when I DID manage to show interest in something/one I would gain an unhealthy obsession to the point where I would get very emotional whenever anyone said anything remotely negative about my obsession\u2026to the point of blocking people out of my life. And then WHEN my obsession was over I wouldn\u2019t give a damn about ANYTHING for YEARS. \n\nIt was torture when I was asked what I wanted to be when I got older. I draw, not really because I enjoy it, I just kinda know how, so people would say that I should be an artist. But then I would get lectured by adults that said I\u2019d be a \u201cstarving artist\u201d and that it was a bad career choice. \n\nSo I just picked electrical engineering because I was on my robotics team (not that I cared about building robots) I just wanted some cool stuff to add to my portfolio\u2026which, didn\u2019t really matter because I just winded up going to a community college anyway\u2026.because I didn\u2019t care for any University\u2019s. I got accepted into all of the ones that I applied to (my school pressured the Seniors to apply to at least 5 Universities) but I couldn\u2019t afford to go to any of them\u2026.and I was NOT about to take out any loans for a school that I was not passionate about attending. \n\nI was in and out of college because I kept changing my major (eventually I just stopped going)\u2026I\u2019ve worked at over 20 jobs and still have no idea what I want to do with my life. \n\nI\u2019ve been on Zoloft (annoying side effects), Buspirone (emptied the entire bottle and felt NOTHING), Trazadone, and now I\u2019m taking Vyvanes 40mg for my ADHD diagnosis (still not feeling anything different) \n\nBeing undiagnosed with all this stuff for so long has really ruined me. \n\nSorry for the long post I just get so very angry when I think of how much of my childhood was just snatched away. \n\n\n\n\n",

Recently, I've had many issues with work paying me out on time + the added debt that keeps coming up because of my poor financial decisions and sudden bills pilling up suddenly. At the very least, if anyone is available to help, I am asking for around $500 just to cover my DMV tags, not realizing that the price had gone up since they were unfortunately due at the beginning of the month when all of this financial depression just started to kick in. There is absolutely no pressure and I'd be more than happy to take more to help with other bills that have stacked, plus I'm open to most plans as far as paying back but that of course can be discussed later. \n\nSome more information to add, I get paid typically every 1st to 15th of every month, that is when work decides to be consistent with their pay periods. I have Zelle, Paypal, and Venmo to both receive and send funds through and of course I'm more than okay with verifying before you send the full amount! I'd be okay with paying back upwards of $50 a week after every payday and will communicate efficiently! Please consider and I thank you so much for reading this! ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 24 now and in my past relationships I\u2019ve only been with men who use me, by sleeping with me and not wanting any more from that. People say that a relationship that would count would last up to four or six months, I\u2019ve only had maybe one long relationship. It\u2019s always been -I Love too much and I was too much for them, and they never gave me a chance. And that was most of my relationships until I was 19 and I met my past boyfriend. And with him it was on and off for about five years. We were into each other and then friends but we like dated twice the First time we dated was for four months the second time was for year and a half. He was the first person who told me about independence, to do things for yourself, that it\u2019s OK not being with others all the time, and taught me to grow into the person I am and I thought a grown a lot. But we\u2019re both in the military and we\u2019ve been long-distance for about three years, and I honestly don\u2019t mind it I really enjoyed it I learned how to gain more independence that way and I felt very secure. But it\u2019s time for us to move and I was terrified, Because I don\u2019t know where the military is gonna put me and I don\u2019t have a choice to do any of that it\u2019s more of a chance or luck. But there was a problem with our relationship and it was the doubt I have in the back of my mind, and because of that pressure from the military it made that problem known .Because I did love him more than he loved me for a long time. I did so much for him express my love so intensely, and he love me back but when he decided to love me back I didn\u2019t feel like it reciprocated what I thought i was I\u2019m supposed to feel. And he had admit that he doesn\u2019t feel love as intensely as I do and I don\u2019t blame him for it, but because I expected him to be more than just a friend and he\u2019s been treating a relationship like we\u2019re friends I honestly thought that once we were together and the last time I visited him he would step up and change her become the person I thought he would be. But realizing that I was disappointing and I try not to hold it against him, just because he didn\u2019t change for this past five years I\u2019ve known him and I\u2019ve changed so much so fast. I\u2019ve traveled a gun in the school I did so many things that I developed and changed a lot. And I noticed that there are a lot of things that I wanted him to do like I wanted him to change not only for me but for himself to become the better version of what he wants because I\u2019ve been trying to do that and it seems like he doesn\u2019t care. The last time I visited him he has the same style since he was a teenager he isn\u2019t relatively organized or have like a sense of what he wants his house to be that it is an embodiment of his mind so it seems very unfinished and indecisive like he doesn\u2019t live here. He also goes back to the same things and doesn\u2019t want to learn other new stuff. I am the type of person if I love someone and they\u2019re into something sometimes I get intensely into what they really like. And I notice he doesn\u2019t do that with me I feel like every time I introduced him to something he doesn\u2019t really look into it or he doesn\u2019t think anything interesting of it, but I do I get into interest and I try to bond of him that way. It\u2019s also when it came to gifts it wasn\u2019t until our break up when he sent me gifts that were meaningful the type of gifts that you walk through a store and you find some thing that you think they might like. He has never done that up until the end, in fact he doesn\u2019t like giving gifts to me even though I see you do the same with his parents or that he does those things with his parents. He only got me gifts I have to ask for which I\u2019m tired and it was one of the biggest things I didn\u2019t like about him. The fact that I have to tell him what I want instead of just him doing those things because he wanted to. The last time I visited him I noticed we had a lot of difference in politics now or mindsets and how we view the world, it seems like there\u2019s a lot of things that I started to not like about him and I wanted to change him in that way. And also with this pressure from the military we decided to compromise by getting married, because that\u2019s the only way we could even be close together, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to do those three years again. I mean I could but if I waited three years for all this right wait another and he hasn\u2019t changed who am I waiting for. And even with this marriage it was a compromise, because the decision for me to stay or go was August last year, but he didn\u2019t bring this conversation up up until we met again in December. So if you wanted to get married to me or wanted to be with me he should\u2019ve done it in August or at least sooner so I could understand that this relationship was worth it. Because it didn\u2019t seem worth it to him until I was there physically and he unpause our relationship from that long distance. Why does our relationship have to unpause every time we see each other and not just continue when we\u2019re apart. Because I was so unsure because he was putting his arms within reach, I wasn\u2019t sure about my relationship with him because he wasn\u2019t sure and he would just wanted me around. And during this time with how America is kind of janky right now back home, I\u2019ve been going through some personal stuff with my family I\u2019ve been changing and I\u2019m trying to develop so fast that someone came by in my life During this entire confusion and conflict I\u2019ve been having with my life. I had a really big fight with my boyfriend and I was comforted by a coworker, and a coworker I got to know within a month made me change a lot about my perspective. I had a crush on his coworker and once I realize that I told my boyfriend and I told him we need to fix your relationship because why the fuck am I feeling this. When I haven\u2019t felt this way for another person in the five years I\u2019ve been with him. And I feel like I didn\u2019t even have enough time, because I started hanging out with my coworker a lot more and I got to know him, and we were very similar than I thought. We both expressed love very deeply for our partners, we both like the same thing a lot more than me and my boyfriend, even though me and my boyfriend have similar interest my boyfriends interest or a little bit more niche. Well my coworker is interest are almost close to exactly my interest, and when I hang out with my coworker more within this month he filled in the blanks my boyfriend couldn\u2019t. He came from a similar background as me unlike my boyfriend who grew up very differently in a strong and understanding family. While my family was broken. My coworker has changed throughout the two years he\u2019s been on the same island as me, and he learned how to love himself, he is learning a lot of things he wants to do and he\u2019s changing for himself things that my boyfriend lacked. And two of the very specific things that I wished my boyfriend would\u2019ve done is finding his own style when it comes to fashion, and then matching or making his girlfriend look nice which is exactly what I wanted him to do but I didn\u2019t know that someone actually thought that as well. I didn\u2019t know someone actually thought the same way about how to express love to someone by giving them gifts letters roses without asking. And when I visited his house once it was very nice neat and it had the same type of vibe that I was going for but in a different style whereas most of the men I visited their houses and was just a mess they were not organized or not together it didn\u2019t even decorate it just seemed like they just did one thing in their house and not lived there. So there was a huge upgrade here. My coworker played out that he wasn\u2019t the type of man women wanted, yes he was he was a fucking gem that woman will want good women know when a good man passes and that was him. He was someone that is so different from the other men I\u2019ve seen. And I\u2019ll try to make it work with my boyfriend but my feelings couldn\u2019t help the fact that I probably had lost Those feelings for him for a while now. Because I couldn\u2019t hear his comfort anymore. My coworker was so similar to me that it was a reflection mirror of the person I am right now \n. And I did and it was my boyfriend and he had the best closure and it was the best feeling to have that closure from him. But my mistake was moving on too fast because I wanted to start something with my coworker and he got scared even though he gave the same love I did that was the past him. He got hurt so much that he changed himself to be calm more independent and because of that he got scared and I scared him off. And with this I realize a lot of patterns of this anxious and avoidant attachment styles. I thought this is always gonna be like a chase. But also I learned that he was a reflection of the person that I wanted to be and gave me a better understanding of what kind of person I want in my life. I think we just had a short time here together and I knew it wasn\u2019t gonna work because we didn\u2019t know each other for long enough. But I was willing to try it but he wasn\u2019t and I felt like I had lost that opportunity to experience this to experience this love with another person. Because I loved loving my boyfriend but I realize that outgrew him drastically. And this person was someone who changed my perspective how love is. But it made me realize that I had patterns I needed a break. Because even though we both loved Hard, these past 2 to 3 years when we both worked on ourselves he didn\u2019t have help and he did this independently, whereas I had my old boyfriend to help me through these types of hurdles. Even though now I\u2019m more emotionally in tune with my emotions my coworker had to suppressed him and through that time I known him I did push a lot and trying to understand him better and he felt vulnerable and didn\u2019t want any of that because he was scared it\u2019s gonna be the same thing. Which honestly I wished he took the chance and not being afraid. Because I felt like it would been different but what was the same was how I was treated the fact that he wanted to push away because I try to hard. I find it kind of funny to people who love too hard I thought those two couldn\u2019t help each other out, but it ended up just changing those two types of people. And it made me realize a lot of negatives about me like I seek validation and I heavily depended on it on other people, and it made me realize the timing was not right the boundaries I had put up and cleaning as I thought I got rid of I transferred my relationship from my old one to my new one as if they were the same thing they were not. Because I fell in love with someone else and I mentally transferred that they were now my support system which they mentally wasn\u2019t prepared for it. So now I work with my coworkers for a year just knowing I lost something amazing just because it\u2019s pacing. And that I didn\u2019t give myself time to give myself space about this relationship. I tried hard fast in order to get through all the bullshit and wanting to get this done quickly so then we can try to see how this year goes only for me to fuck up. I thought I was independent and that all these habits were gone, they realize that they were not gone know some thing I had to actively stop myself from doing. How the hell can you meet someone perfect and just fumble it like that. By being yourself, there\u2019s a lot of red flags that he did avoided was how attached I was. And I honestly felt like I was robbed of this like life rob me of this because. He was almost great at everything, and he played it down like he wasn\u2019t all that. But you don\u2019t know how amazing this fucking man is and I expose myself too much and now he wants space and I feel a lot of regret. Like with my ex-boyfriend I don\u2019t feel any regret, so why does it feel like I lost someone that was worth it. I feel like life has been doing that to me a lot showing me great people in the short amount of time, I just spiral to see and think about how I messed up this bad I can\u2019t over explain my feelings anymore because it just overwhelms him. I don\u2019t get to see a lot of men like this you don\u2019t see a lot of good men like this at least where I come from. And now being in the league to where I am now how fuck am I gonna find someone the same league as me or better because I don\u2019t know how relationships are. Will this be the one chance I\u2019ll never get back?",

I have $10,000 in savings but plan to put down $5,000, plus a $2,000 trade-in, leaving me with a car loan to cover the rest.( Honda Civic.) \n\nI haven\u2019t told my family that I want to leave yet, but I sometimes get subtle hints\u2014questions about whether I\u2019ll take the \u201cnarrow\u201d or \u201cwide\u201d path (if you know, you know). I don\u2019t feel overwhelming pressure, but it\u2019s there. Deep down, I don\u2019t think they would shun me, but I can\u2019t be 100% sure. That\u2019s why I\u2019m questioning whether buying this car is a smart decision right now, especially if things don\u2019t go as I hope and I end up on my own financially.\n\nAt the same time, I want to live my life on my own terms. I\u2019m already on a sports team with \u201cworldly\u201d people, and my mom not only allows it but even enjoys watching my games. That makes me feel like I might not be in as much danger of being cut off as others in my situation. But I still feel stuck\u2014like I dream and dream about my future, but never take action because I feel suffocated by my current environment.\n\nAs I approach 19, I know I need to start making real moves. But I\u2019m struggling with an existential crisis about what I want to do after I leave. Should I take this step and buy the car, or would it be too risky given my situation?\n\n ",

        "selftext": "Hello this is my first post i'm making and I have no one to vent to so i'm trying this sorry if this is the wrong place to post it just felt right and if it doesn't make much since im crying writing this. \n\nIm 16F i know very young to be \"depressed\" but i feel like it started when my dad got sick at around 7 i seen my dad having a stroke and going into a coma i was very close to my dad i did basically everything with him \n\nhe was in a coma for like about 6 months and i thought i lost the only parent who understood me i cried mostly all the time because 7yo me thought i tired him out and he didn't wanna hang out with me anymore and did this as an excuse to stop my mom was in my life but she was just there she never really cared about anything as long as we were getting fed and bathed she didn't show up to any parent teacher conferences no concerts nothing i wasnt even close to her growing up i always felt like she had some kinda hatred towards me \n\nbut back to my dad my mom let me visit him maybe a 2 times while he was in the hospital while she let all my other siblings go multiple and i just thought oh maybe she doesn't want me to see my dad since we're very close and it would break me but after he came out the hospital instead of him raising me i basically raised him at the age of 8 did everything to feeding him since he was paralyzed from the right side and many more things \n\na couple years go back hes still struggling but he's doing much better from when he was released from the hospital then my mom broke aswell and she would argue with him all the time till she kicked him out the house and i was so made because you expect someone with a brain identical to a 4yo can live by himself he didn't know how to talk how to read nothing and she didn't have no remorse for him and even called the cops to kick him out the house \n\nthat's when i seen red with my mom and hated her ever since and it made our relationship worse and worse by the second she even hated me too because we barley talked she would always single me out and defended all of her other kids if i had gotten into it with them she would body shame me and say stuff that made my depression worse like she would say why my ass shake so much when i walked and would asked if i was doing the deed with boys (i was 10 at the time and i didn't even know what that was yet and i was just thick because i had her genes) \n\nshe would also let me know she hated me and would say i wish you would die and would tell me to go kill myself so she can be happy and free without me bothering her life and she said that's she'd only cry for one day because im not worth her tears all i could do is just cry to myself and move on \n\n\nwhen i was 15 i got a boyfriends and i would vent to him and talk to him about my feelings which helped a bit but when she would side with my siblings would be the worst even if there in the wrong the day of my birthday turning 14 i got into with my sister she was like a couple years older than me because i was playing with my little sister she would whoop me and make me stay in the room but no one was home i was bored so i came out the room and she did that a couple more times till i got sick of it and i got what she was whooping me and i whooped her back but worse and she called my mom \n\nwhen my mom came home she just started beating on me and didn't even listen to what i had to say and when i said i wanna leave and go like with my dad she got something i don't even remember she hit me with it and i ran away my adrenaline was so high it took over but she ended up calling the cops and me and i stayed over at an aunts house with bruises all over my body and no one cared\n\ni came home the next day like everything was normal she didn't even apologize calling the cops became one of her regular things to do to the point where mostly every cop knew me \n\nthen instead of her beating on me she would call my older sister and her brother on me and they would strangle me and her brother even broke my arm from twisting behind my back i felt useless every time i'd run away the cops did nothing and brought me back home like nothing happened \n\ni fell into a hole i was suffering i would cut myself i would even try hanging myself until the day that i stopped considering that lady \"my mom\" it was a normal day i guess but i was arguing with my brother and he was pissing me off and i kicked him away from me and 2 of my older sisters jumped me and i couldn't do anything but take the punches because i was sitting and when my mom came out she didn't even asked what happened she just started yelling at me i ran into the only room that had a lock (yes all the rooms the locks were broken so my mom could come in whenever she wanted) and i locked myself in there for hours \n\nuntil she had enough and called the cops on me at 6am and all i hear her saying is \"that girl is crazy i don't want her anymore she's not my daughter put her up for adoption for all i care i don't want that girl in my house\" it shattered my heart into pieces i blanked out and next thing i know my mom told them to admit me into a psych ward for days even thought the doctors questions why i was there since i was totally fine but my mom just refused to pick me up every time they called she would say no to picking me up \n\nuntil they told her that i can't stay here anymore and i have to she did and she acted like she was shocked in what happened i lost a lot of weight because i refused to eat all she did was take me to a distant uncle (i barley even know him) and he begged me to forgive her she didn't even ask herself i didn't even care anymore i was so done with her \n\nshe would yell at me constantly till i had enough and i overdosed on pills and i would've been gone right now if my boyfriend didnt call an ambulance for me when i got out i thought she'd be more supportive and understanding that i was depressed but all i got was her yelling at me now im here 16yo depressed have no friends because my mom doesn't let me out the house im basically on house arrest its just school to home 5 days a week and nothing else i dont work a job because i have no one to take me \n\nppl im stuck and im drained please help im desperate!

        "selftext": "Hello,  \nThrowaway account for reasons.\n\nI can't keep living with my wife anymore. She verbally abuses me on a daily basis, it doesn't matter the reason: If I prepare our child's dinner she complains I take too much time and she can't make her own, or my menu for our kid is not good enough and she'll do it from next day (spoiler: no, she doesn't. she's too lazy.) If I tidy up the toys she complains later that she can't find this or that.\n\nWe're together for 8 years, married 6 and with a 5 years old. Obviously she was not like this until our baby was born. From that, her true self appeared. She complains about me, that I'm stupid because I can't understand 100% japanese, or selfish because she does \"everything\" for our kid (sure, thats why every weekend she's still sleeping while I already did cleaning, laundry and took our kid to the park or zoo or whatever... every single weekend. And of course I take our kid to sleep because my wife is \"too stressed.\")\n\nOne day that she lost her shit for some stupid thing I called her out and told her, politely, to not scream in front of our kid. She throw the cup she had in her hand to the floor and said that she wanted divorce. I replied that if we do it I'll have to go back to my country and our kid will lose his father. She said that \"you can come visit him once a year.\"  \nFrom that day I made up my mind to get the PR as soon as possible and leave.  \nBut the japanese government decided that even after living here for 5 years, having a kid and beign a seishain was not enough to grant a pr, as 3 years prior, when I still was a part timer, I paid a week later the nenkin.\n\nAnd here we are now. My wife abusing me on a daily basis. I'm walking on eggshells, trying to hold on for maybe 2 more years so I can apply and have my PR granted. But I can't hold anymore.  \nI'm seriously considering to go back to my country, even if it means to leave my child behind.  \nIt breaks my heart as I take care of him at least, if not more, than my wife.   \nI play with him before school and after school. Most of the days I make his dinner, take him to the bath, and daily we sleep together.  \nBut in days like today I just can't stand it anymore. She didn't have enough with abusing me in the morning at home for a mistake that she made but according to she, its my fault, that she even did it by Line while I'm at work.\n\nI'm thinking to apply for the Long Term Resident visa, as my work wont sponsor me, but I just don't trust the japanese government - they didn't granted the PR even with a kid before, so why would they now?  \nAlso, as we use her account to pay our bills, I have almost no money. Not enough to rent an apartment, live, and hire a lawyer.  \nI just can't go on living like this. Feeling like shit, depressed, and waiting until I can apply for the PR again, just in the hopes they grant it. I really don't want to leave my child here and live in another country, I right now I'm crying in the toilet of my office because I can't take the abuse anymore.\n\nI need help, or advice, but I know it's impossible.  \nSome months ago I shared a similar post, I know no one can help me.  \n  \nI've contacted houterasu but they don't really offer legal support, just advice (\"you need a lawyer, here's a list of english speaking lawyers.) I talked to my embassy, nothing they can do.  \nEither grind this life of abuse or go home without my child.  \nBut after years of suffering, moving back to my country just sounds ok...\n\nSorry for this long post.  \nThank you for reading.",

        "selftext": "I grew up in a Christian fundamentalist household (or at least my dad specifically was and still is one). When I was a kid, I used to believe in most of the stuff he would watch and spew from conspiracy theories about the Illuminati, anti-Catholicism (I wasn't really anti-Catholic), homophobia, young-Earth creationism,  KJV-onlyism, and so on. It was greatly influential on me, and I would also spew this out as well.\n\nIt wasn't until freshman year of highschool where I started to question my faith, so I became an atheist, like an edgy type where I view anyone who was religious as delusional or an idiot. When I did became an atheist, I still believed in most of the things my dad told me, but not the religion stuff. Fortunately, as I gotten older, I became less and less fundamentalist and became a lot more open-minded. And also stopped with the edgy atheist type, and became more moderate on it as well.\n\nWhich now brings me to 2023. This was by far the worst year for me, and it took a toll on my mental health. I had to cut ties with someone, my cat died that year from cancer. These two things made me felt hopeless and depressed. I started to have a existential crisis and it was all so overwhelming.\n\nNow we go to 2024. 2024 started out a lot worse for me as my depression from 2023 continued. My mental health was really low here. I didn't feel like doing much of anything such as playing video games or voice acting. I didn't even had it in me to end it all either, but I did felt so lonely. Luckily, in March or April of that year, I got a DM on Reddit from someone that if I wanted to join an adult only discord server full of Nintendo fans, and given how shitty my mental health was at the time, I accepted it immediately.  And it helped considerably, and I met some really cool people there too. Even though, for a little a while, I wasn't really that active there until mid 2024. I know I kinda went on a tangent there, but this was honestly important to the story, if I wasn't for this Discord server, I probably wouldn't be here today, let alone had this journey.\n\nNow we go to late 2024, this is where I started getting philosophical. I started to think about where we came from and why are we here. I was honestly thinking of either going back to being a Christian, but not the fundie type, or be agnostic. And then, I started to type on Google about the types of religions, and I stumbled upon deism. And I forgot that deism was a thing, and I wanted to see if it best describe me, and it really did. I was still debating on what I should be. And then finally on December of 2024, I became a deist and it really has helped. While I don't consider myself a Christian deist, but Christianity has influenced my deistic beliefs. Believing in a supreme being while not following any religion has improved my mental health a lot.\n",

        "selftext": "Hello,  \nThrowaway account for reasons.\n\nI can't keep living with my wife anymore. She verbally abuses me on a daily basis, it doesn't matter the reason: If I prepare our child's dinner she complains I take too much time and she can't make her own, or my menu for our kid is not good enough and she'll do it from next day (spoiler: no, she doesn't. she's too lazy.) If I tidy up the toys she complains later that she can't find this or that.\n\nWe're together for 8 years, married 6 and with a 5 years old. Obviously she was not like this until our baby was born. From that, her true self appeared. She complains about me, that I'm stupid because I can't understand 100% japanese, or selfish because she does \"everything\" for our kid (sure, thats why every weekend she's still sleeping while I already did cleaning, laundry and took our kid to the park or zoo or whatever... every single weekend. And of course I take our kid to sleep because my wife is \"too stressed.\")\n\nOne day that she lost her shit for some stupid thing I called her out and told her, politely, to not scream in front of our kid. She throw the cup she had in her hand to the floor and said that she wanted divorce. I replied that if we do it I'll have to go back to my country and our kid will lose his father. She said that \"you can come visit him once a year.\"  \nFrom that day I made up my mind to get the PR as soon as possible and leave.  \nBut the japanese government decided that even after living here for 5 years, having a kid and beign a seishain was not enough to grant a pr, as 3 years prior, when I still was a part timer, I paid a week later the nenkin.\n\nAnd here we are now. My wife abusing me on a daily basis. I'm walking on eggshells, trying to hold on for maybe 2 more years so I can apply and have my PR granted. But I can't hold anymore.  \nI'm seriously considering to go back to my country, even if it means to leave my child behind.  \nIt breaks my heart as I take care of him at least, if not more, than my wife.   \nI play with him before school and after school. Most of the days I make his dinner, take him to the bath, and daily we sleep together.  \nBut in days like today I just can't stand it anymore. She didn't have enough with abusing me in the morning at home for a mistake that she made but according to she, its my fault, that she even did it by Line while I'm at work.\n\nI'm thinking to apply for the Long Term Resident visa, as my work wont sponsor me, but I just don't trust the japanese government - they didn't granted the PR even with a kid before, so why would they now?  \nAlso, as we use her account to pay our bills, I have almost no money. Not enough to rent an apartment, live, and hire a lawyer.  \nI just can't go on living like this. Feeling like shit, depressed, and waiting until I can apply for the PR again, just in the hopes they grant it. I really don't want to leave my child here and live in another country, I right now I'm crying in the toilet of my office because I can't take the abuse anymore.\n\nI need help, or advice, but I know it's impossible.  \nSome months ago I shared a similar post, I know no one can help me.  \n  \nI've contacted houterasu but they don't really offer legal support, just advice (\"you need a lawyer, here's a list of english speaking lawyers.) I talked to my embassy, nothing they can do.  \nEither grind this life of abuse or go home without my child.  \nBut after years of suffering, moving back to my country just sounds ok...\n\nSorry for this long post.  \nThank you for reading.",

        "selftext": "So, being neurodivergent comes with the perk of being hyper aware of everything and everyone around you. I see it in my kids when they pick out wild details in shows/movies that even I didn\u2019t grab (my four year old picked up that the chaise Cinderella flipped over in the attic was her dying mothers in a scene 12 minutes before) he\u2019s 4! Anyway, I digress. Back to noticing things and my statement regarding narcissism. Do you ever get the feeling that you are say 4D and the vast majority of people are 3 or possibly 2? As if sometimes you\u2019re surrounded by NPCs? I don\u2019t mean to say that the people I am referring to aren\u2019t intelligent, just less aware and less phased or impacted by the world around them. I have always had a certain envy for those people. They just go around living life, ignoring drama or the impeding doom, minding their own business and happy? I have to admit the older I get, the easier it is but man the last 20 years has been nothing but constant overwhelm and overload. There is always something to be done, that should be done. Something that wasn\u2019t said, that should have been said or shouldn\u2019t have been said. We are meant for so much more than what our current societal constructs serves us. An analogy I use often is how if you don\u2019t run your dog and give it the exercise and attention it needs, while you\u2019re out it will eat the couch. That\u2019s about where I\u2019m at.

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI know that a blood stain can be a blood stain, but I was wondering how often in people's experience these things occur? Twice exactly a week apart in February and once just today I have noticed blood spots on my bedding on the half where the top part of my body is. I'm incredibly anxious about bedbugs and have conducted a bit of a search but it's difficult to determine what a stain is because I live in university housing and while the mattresses are new the bed frames are ancient and have all sorts of marks and debris. I did find an anxiety-provoking something on the corners of my mattress only for it to flake away before I could take a look at it, so I'm assuming gunk.\n\nAnyway, while I do have acne I really can't find any information online on how rare or common accidentally squishing a bedbug in the night is during an infestation. I have heard some people say it was rare for them. I also have no idea what size is typical. Mine are a couple mm across but seem too big to come from the pin-prick of a bite. Going to pest control websites has been pretty fruitless as they mostly use stock images of blood stains when they do talk about it. I'm just at a loss here! Any advice would be appreciated as I'm basically all alone in a foreign country for my studies and don't really have anywhere else to turn to for advice. ",

He chews cords, furniture, the metal hardware on my cabinets \u2014 everything! \n\nBoth boys are neutered, have many, many toys, multiple scratch posts (both horizontal and vertical), cat towers, an automated laser toy, an automated feather toy\u2026 I\u2019ve bought so many toys to try to get him to chew those instead of dangerous stuff.  \n\nBoth cats eat and drink well. They\u2019re up to date on their vaccinations, vet appointments etc. They play GREAT together, wrestle, play fight, groom each other, snuggle. \n\nI play with them a LOT. At least 1-2 hours a day. I work from home so we have a lot of time together. \n\nI know pica is a possibility. I really don\u2019t think my chewer seems anxious. The person I adopted them from mentioned that he chewed cords, so I don\u2019t think this is a new behavior either. My suspicion is he\u2019s bored/attention seeking even though he plays with me and his brother a lot. \n\nI\u2019ve put cat deterrent on cords etc, but he will literally chew about anything. I can\u2019t spray the whole house, and I\u2019m worried about his safety and am at my wit\u2019s end fretting about whether he\u2019s going to hurt himself. \n\nAny thoughts/suggestions will be welcome! Also any stories about kittens who eventually grew out of this stage. Thanks and sorry for the long post. ",

But throughout the night she kept telling me I can get closer and being very pushy and eventually I said yes. So I keep talking to her and eventually I found out the night we met up and did stuff she had a glass of wine with her dinner about 3 hours earlier. She drove from the restaurant back to hotel. I got super freaked out by this and ended up asking her if I made her uncomfortable and if she was okay with everything. She said she had plenty of water and just one glass with dinner and said she sobered up by then and enjoyed the night. I did end up going over to her house next week and we did hook up then we eventually cut things off. But I'm just scared I did something that could be bad and this keeps replaying in my head and is now affecting my life, I feel disgusting. The first night I went over I really didn't want to do anything and I told her anything sexual was not on my mind but she just kept pushing. I did ask her multiple times during the first encounter if what we where doing was okay, and we even discussed her college work and some things she was interested she seemed completely sound of mind. I think its possible she may have mentioned having a glass with dinner but I was just so incredibly anxious. I'm scared that she was lying to me and I did something really bad (I promise I will only ask once here)",

I've followed this game's development since it was originally announced, and I would like to just share my opinion on the game and possibly invite others to share theirs as well as we are about to get towards release. I'm going to start off with the things I like from all the gameplay we've seen. The world looks absolutely stunning and is exactly what I imagined the dune universe looking like. They really did the sandworm mechanic perfectly, and the combination of base building along with the environment is going to be an amazing experience for anyone who plays (I don't know if I'm going to buy it yet). Secondly, the guild idea and weekly reset looks extremely fun and hopefully will keep the community around each week. The guild system is an awesome way to do the politics in Dune, and an MMO/Survival experience is perfect for what they are going for. Really excited to see the RP/Guilds work together during spice blows and stuff like that. Now, to begin with my complaints. The melee combat and combat in general with npc's/pve looks miserable. The animations are extremely stiff, the AI seems completely braindead, and it seems very dmg spongey. The parry mechanic is a big plus, but with ping issues it may not even function properly. Secondly, it's created by Funcom. Not to be negative towards the employees, I believe they did amazing work with a lot of parts of the game, but Funcom is notorious for rushed releases that fail the game. I'm hoping that the 5 day early release may help with servers and other issues, but I don't even see the game peaking above 40k. I was genuinely excited for the game, but the stiff animations and the company around the game have me anxious towards release and possible changes. Melee should have been worked on more before announcing a release, but everything else looks really solid for release and seem really fun. I'm hoping the player-base stays around for awhile, but I can totally see this game dying in a month\n2. On the Funcom thing, they should continually update the game so hopefully it turns into no mans sky ",

        "selftext": "For a long time, I've struggled with a lack of desire to live. Among other issues, my therapist and I have focused on trying to find ways to add \"purpose\" or \"meaning\" to my life so that I might develop a desire to live. We have discussed topics from art and music, to dance and yoga, to running and cycling, to adrenaline-junkie activities like skydiving.\n\nMy existing career and hobbies aren't sufficient. My therapist's rationale is that if my existing career and hobbies were sufficient, then I would already be happy enough to want to live.\n\nI currently have a regular exercise routine of incline brisk walk for cardio, plus weightlifting, but as above: if that were sufficient, I would already be happy.\n\nIn the same vein: I've worked in the tech industry for over a decade, and this has been a strong interest of mine since high school (I'm 34)--but, again, if that were sufficient, I would already be happy. I have hobbies including board games, card games, dinners with friends, and my aforementioned exercise routine--but, again, if that were sufficient, I would already be happy.\n\nMy therapist asked me today if a prior project [which I had been talking about just before] brought me enjoyment/joy or happiness. I said I don't think so, or I don't know--something to that effect. However, just now, in the late afternoon post-session, I was reflecting on the project some more and I realized that I *did* experience enjoyment. I also realized that I experience enjoyment while building another, current personal project.\n\nIt just doesn't outweigh the day-to-day suffering caused by body dysmorphia (it's technically gender dysphoria, but I can't/won't transition, so I consider myself a biological female with body dysmorphia). Hence, I still have a number of dark thoughts every day despite finding enjoyment in my life.\n\nLaypeople on another subreddit claim it's depression. The problem is that I've already been evaluated for depression twice, and don't meet the criteria. I don't have clinically significant distress. I work full-time, exercise daily, have multiple hobbies, etc., but the mental pain I live in every day simply outweighs all of that.\n\nHow can I explain this to my therapist?",

        "selftext": "Hey! \n\nHave you ever felt overwhelmed trying to standardize complex business processes while juggling multiple tasks? \n\nThis prompt chain is designed to break down the often daunting task of documenting and standardizing business operations into manageable pieces. It not only makes the process systematic but also ensures consistency and clarity across your documentation. It\u2019s especially useful for business process analysts and documentation specialists looking to enhance efficiency within their [BUSINESS TYPE].\n\n## How This Prompt Chain Works\n\nThis chain is designed to help you identify key business processes, draft detailed step-by-step operational procedures, and finally consolidate them into a well-organized, standardized document. \n\n1. **Process Identification:** First, the chain asks you to review your business operations and list up to five crucial processes that need standardization. This helps in pinpointing areas where consistency matters the most.\n2. **Action Steps Elaboration:** Next, it guides you through detailing the exact steps for each process, ensuring every task is actionable and easy to follow.\n3. **SOP Template Creation:** The subsequent prompts focus on creating a clear, structured Standard Operating Procedure template. This ensures all documentation includes essential sections like Title, Purpose, Scope, Responsibilities, Procedure, Required Materials, and Review Date.\n4. **Detailed SOP Drafting:** The chain then instructs you to draft complete SOPs for identified processes, staying within a specific word count to ensure clarity and conciseness.\n5. **Quality Assurance:** It then moves to reviewing and refining the SOPs to ensure they meet organizational quality standards.\n6. **Consolidation for Navigation:** Finally, it guides you to consolidate all these SOPs into one cohesive, easily navigable document with a Table of Contents for quick reference.\n\nThe tildes (~) in the prompt chain act as separators, delineating each major section of your workflow. And don\u2019t forget, the variable [BUSINESS TYPE] is crucial\u2014it lets you tailor the process to your specific industry.\n\n## The Prompt Chain\n\n```\n[BUSINESS TYPE] = Type of Business\n\nThis variable will act as a key indicator in your overall prompt chain to specify the business category. Please ensure clarity and consistency with the rest of your variable definitions.\n\nYou are a business process analyst tasked with enhancing consistency and efficiency within [BUSINESS TYPE]. Your objective is to identify and prioritize the key processes or tasks that are essential for standardization. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Review the operations of [BUSINESS TYPE] to determine which processes or tasks are critical for maintaining smooth and consistent performance.\n2. Identify up to five key processes or tasks that, if standardized, would contribute significantly to efficiency and consistency.\n3. Create a numbered list (1 through 5) of these processes, ranking them by their importance. Provide a brief explanation for each selection, detailing its role in enhancing consistency and overall efficiency.\n\nFormat your answer as follows:\n1. Process/Task Name \u2013 Brief explanation of its importance\n2. ...\n\nEnsure each listed process is specific, measurable, and directly tied to improved operational performance.\n\n~\n\nYou are a business process analyst tasked with detailing the action steps for each process identified in the previous prompt. Your objective is to provide a clear, step-by-step guide that can be easily implemented to perform each process effectively.\n\nInstructions:\n1. For each process already identified, list the necessary steps to execute it efficiently.\n2. Provide between 3 and 7 steps for each process. Number each step sequentially.\n3. Use clear, action-oriented language to describe each step, ensuring that every instruction is specific and measurable.\n4. Structure your answer by first stating the process name, followed by the numbered steps for that process.\n\nOutput Format Example:\nProcess Name: [Insert Process Title]\n   1. Step one description\n   2. Step two description\n   3. Step three description\n\nEnsure that your breakdown is detailed enough to guide implementation and consistent with the overall process standardization goals.\n\n~\n\nYou are a documentation specialist responsible for creating standardized templates. Your task is to design a clear and structured template for a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document. Follow these detailed instructions:\n\n1. Develop a template that includes the following sections:\n   a. Title \u2013 Clearly state the SOP title\n   b. Purpose \u2013 Describe the rationale and objectives\n   c.

Review Date \u2013 Specify the schedule for periodic review and updates\n\n2. Organize the template in a logical sequence that facilitates understanding and usability.\n3. Use headings and subheadings to clearly demarcate each section.\n4. Ensure that the template can be easily customized for various processes within [BUSINESS TYPE].\n\nYour output should be a complete text-based template that clearly demarcates each section with appropriate formatting instructions (e.g., using bold or underlined headings if needed).\n\n~\n\nYou are a documentation specialist tasked with drafting the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the first process identified. Using the SOP template provided earlier, your goal is to produce a clear, concise, and well-structured SOP that adheres to the following criteria:\n\n1. Use the following sections in your SOP, ensuring each section is clearly labeled with a heading:\n   a. Title \u2013 Provide a concise title for the SOP.\n   b. Purpose \u2013 Explain the objective or rationale behind the SOP.\n   c. Scope \u2013 Define the boundaries and applicability of the process.\n   d. Responsibilities \u2013 Detail who is accountable for each part of the process.\n   e. Procedure \u2013 Outline a step-by-step guide for the process.\n   f. Required Materials \u2013 List any tools, resources, or materials needed.\n   g. Review Date \u2013 Indicate the scheduled date for reviewing or updating the document.\n\n2. Ensure that each section is written in clear and unambiguous language, focusing on action-oriented instructions.\n3. Keep the total document length between 300 and 500 words.\n4. Maintain consistency with the overall format and style used in previous documentation tasks for [BUSINESS TYPE].\n\nOutput Format: Provide your SOP in plain text with clearly demarcated sections using headings (for example, in bold or underlined text), ensuring that your document is both professional and easy-to-follow.\n\n~\n\nYou are a documentation specialist tasked with drafting the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the second process identified within [BUSINESS TYPE]. Using the established SOP template that includes the sections: Title, Purpose, Scope, Responsibilities, Procedure, Required Materials, and Review Date, complete the following instructions:\n\n1. Develop a clear and professionally structured SOP document that reflects the process accurately.\n2. Ensure that the SOP uses the same template and layout as the first process to maintain overall consistency and branding.\n3. Emphasize the key process steps by providing detailed, action-oriented instructions under the Procedure section.\n4. Maintain consistency in style, tone, and wording throughout the document, aligning with previous SOPs for [BUSINESS TYPE].\n5. The final SOP should be written in clear, unambiguous language with all sections clearly labeled. Aim for a total length of approximately 300 to 500 words.\n\nYour deliverable should be a text-based SOP document with formatted headings (e.g., bold or underlined) for each section, ensuring ease of readability and consistency with your overall documentation framework.\n\n~\n\nYou are a documentation specialist responsible for creating consistent and high-quality Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for [BUSINESS TYPE]. Your next task is to draft the SOP for the third process using the established SOP template. Please adhere to the following instructions:\n\n1. Use the same SOP template provided in earlier tasks, which includes the following sections:\n   - Title\n   - Purpose\n   - Scope\n   - Responsibilities\n   - Procedure\n   - Required Materials\n   - Review Date\n\n2. Write the SOP clearly and concisely, ensuring that each section is properly labeled with formatted headings (e.g., bold or underlined) for easy readability.\n\n3. Provide detailed, actionable insights for each section, with a particular emphasis on the Procedure. Use step-by-step, action-oriented instructions to ensure that the process can be easily followed by the end user.\n\n4. Maintain consistency in style, tone, and format with the previous SOP documents created for the first and second processes.\n\n5. Ensure that the final document is clear, precise, and structured in a way that facilitates implementation. Aim for a total length of approximately 300-500 words.\n\nYour deliverable should be a text-based SOP document that adheres to the above guidelines and enhances clarity and precision in detailing the third process.\n\n~\n\nYou are a Documentation Quality Assurance Specialist responsible for ensuring that each Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document aligns with the organization\u2019s quality standards. Your task is to review all SOP documents created in previous steps and refine them for enhanced clarity, completeness, and consistency. \n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Review each SOP document thoroughly, verifying that all sections (Title, Purpose, Scope, Responsibilities, Procedure, Required Materials, and Review Date) are present and accurately filled out.\n2. Evaluate the clarity of language, the detail provided in each section, and the overall formatting. Check for any discrepancies or areas that require better explanation.\n3. Make necessary revisions to improve the clarity, detail, or format of the documents. Ensure that instructions are action-oriented and that each SOP is easy to follow.\n4. Document any specific changes made and provide a brief rationale for those revisions if required by your quality assurance process.\n\nEnsure that your reviews are consistent with the established SOP template and maintain the professional tone used throughout the previous documentation tasks for [BUSINESS TYPE].\n\nOutput Format: Provide your revised SOP documents in plain text with clearly marked headings for each section, along with a brief summary of any major revisions made.\n\n~\n\nYou are a documentation specialist tasked with consolidating all previously created Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) documents into a single, well-organized document. Your objective is to ensure that the final document is user-friendly, easily navigable, and provides quick access to all SOPs through a structured layout. Follow these detailed instructions:\n\n1. Consolidation: Gather all individual SOP documents created in earlier steps.\n   - Ensure that each SOP is complete and follows the previously defined template.\n\n2. Organization: Compile the SOPs into one cohesive document.\n   - Arrange them in a logical order, such as by process number or alphabetical order, to facilitate easy reference.\n\n3. Table of Contents: Create a Table of Contents at the beginning of the document.\n   - Include clear links (or references) to each SOP section so users can quickly navigate to the desired procedure.\n   - Ensure that each entry in the Table of Contents accurately reflects the corresponding SOP title.\n\n4. Formatting and Accessibility: Ensure the final document is formatted for clarity and ease of access.\n   - Use consistent heading styles, numbering, and spacing throughout the document.\n   - Check that the links in the Table of Contents work correctly (if using a digital format) or are clearly referenced (if printed).\n\nYour final deliverable should be a text-based document that is both professional and easy to navigate. Ensure that all details are accurate and that the document meets the standards for clarity and organization as established in previous tasks.\nLink: https://www.agenticworkers.com/library/5-4qntab8whacyk0mev91-standard-operating-procedures-sops-development\n```\n\n### Understanding the Variables\n- [BUSINESS TYPE]: This variable is used to specify the type of business or industry you\u2019re working within.

I complained and grumbled and thought about quitting for years but never came up with a plan to do so. I have also been using THC carts for 5 years and have been involved with cannabis for some 15 years. I was getting very overwhelmed and anxious at work and maybe a little manic. I finally quit with one week notice. They were sad to see me go and said I was a good worker and can come back.\n\nFast forward 3 months and I am doing nothing but vaping and lying on the floor. I am afraid to leave my house and losing my mind. I'm starting to think that maybe my anxiety, THC addiction, isolation, and poor social skills might have been my problem. My job was really bad for me and probably going to kill me eventually, but I enjoyed having the purpose, structure, and social circle. I spend too much time ruminating and perhaps shouldn't even be here. I think venting is probably a bad idea.\n\nHow can I find a way out of this? I was a very hard worker for 9 years and now, I'm nothing. How do I move forward and find a path?",

After the discouraging realization I was unable to put a sim in my basement due to ceiling height, I hired a contractor to build an extension on the home. The plans drawn are a 20 deep 30 wide with 10ft ceilings. The width will include a 1 car garage with drywall in between so sim space expected to be 20 deep by 18 wide. \n\nI have a sim installation company that basically quotes out all the parts at cost from 3rd parties and then installs for $4.5k. Looking to go with the Uneekor EyeXO (or should I go XO2)? He also mentioned Apogee was up and coming but new back in June when I had all of this quoted out. \n\nBreaking ground on Monday and can\u2019t be more excited. Already getting anxious that I should go a little deeper than the 20 but I live in a cookie cutter neighborhood and didn\u2019t want to go to crazy. \n\nFeel free to throw any suggestions my way as the build starts. Planning on doing a 3 panel accordion door for indoor outdoor feel and putting a 2nd screen in front of impact screen to drop down for movies and games. \n\nPanPT-VMZ51U projector. I\u2019ll take build pictures as they start to go up. \n\nWhat should I do for temp control. Was thinking just a wall unit with remote control? Live in Midwest so we get the negatives up to 100 and everything in between.  \n\nThanks in advance for any thoughtful comments!\n\n\n\n",

Just as a disclaimer I am feeling pretty depressed right now, which just means I'm binge eating and a little tired. I'll get over it but I just wanted to be straightforward!\n\nI'm a typical reddit nerd, I like fantasy style movies and shows. Definitely play too many video games. Mostly WoW, Smash Bros, Battle Royals with friends\n\nI go to the gym often, 5 or 6 times a week, so if that was something you are into that would be awesome. I try and eat well but have a snack once, twice, 5 times a week.\n\nI like to write, and I am learning to play drums, but I'm terrible lol. Just trying to be at least a little creative in my old age. I listen to a lot of different types of music, and am happy with almost any genre. Most of the TV I watch is typical nerdy fantasy or anime. However I do really like The West Wing & The Wire too.\n\nNot looking for someone who likes exactly the same things I do but just someone who has interests and curiosities. I enjoy the banter more than anything.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/me-f3kCm5S",

        "selftext": "The age old adage is \"it is better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all\".\n\nI am approaching 3 years post D-Day - still trying to get divorced. And all these \"happy\" (\\*eye roll\\*) memories keep surfacing....\n\nLike how he blamed me for a \"lack of sex drive\". I have had major depressive disorder (diagnosed at age 5) and I take anti-depressants. Of course that is a commonly known side effect. He glommed onto that as the reason we weren't having more sex. Except when we got married we had no issues...\n\nI changed my meds. I saw a sex therapist. I \"worked on myself\". And he changed the goal posts.\n\nHe was willing to fuck around with my mental and physical health. He was prepared to let me fall into deep depression. He happily gaslit me and manipulated me to believe everything was my fault (and of course I was already \"crazy\"). I remember the countless times I cried in the bathroom, trying to figure out what was wrong with me that my own husband didn't even want to sleep with me. \n\nThree years and I still have a hard time looking at myself in the mirror. I still feel ugly and unlovable. I still cry myself to sleep.\n\nPrior to this, despite dealing with physiological depression, I did pretty well....until I found out my entire adult life was a lie. And he felt the need to tell me that he never loved me or saw me in a romantic way. How he couldn't wait to be intimate with someone he actually loved and was attracted to. Apparently I was just a platonic \"friend\" and had never been any more. Married for 20 years.\n\nI loved him. I thought we were going to grow old together. I had so many dreams. And he lied. He lied to my face. For years. And then he became this cruel monster during the divorce process. He screamed at me that I wasn't even worthy of basic respect. That he owed me nothing. And he left me with nothing (literally). I lost everything in my life and everything I had ever loved (including all but 2 people I had thought were my \"friends\"). \n\nI don't want to be alive anymore. I have all the specialists. I take the meds. I go to regular therapy. I have done rTMS. I get up every morning and I drag myself through each day. I lived with a man for 20 years and he hated me so much that he made sure I had nothing left.\n\nIs this really worth loving and losing?\n\nI will get up. And I will go through another day. But I don't know how to get beyond this point. I will never understand the cruelty. None of this had to happen. He could have been up front about what was going on. He could have apologized. Recognized the trauma he caused. He could have helped clear out the house and sell it. He could have helped pay for his own pets. Instead he dumped it all on me and walked out. He could have even just talked to me. I don't even know what the truth is. \n\nI don't know what is real in my own life.\n\nIt's pretty sad when you start wishing for a brain injury....so you can forget your own life.\n\nAll you straight spouses out there - you are warriors. Whether you know it or not.",

I just want to run outside, or like finish my spring cleaning I started recently, hit my head against the wall anything to get rid of it. I eat setraline and I dont feel particularly anxious or depressed about anything specific at tye moment, and I also eat Inderal for anxiety heart palpitations but it hasnt had any effect. So I dont think its anxiety. I thought it maybe was hunger becaue I forgot to eat all day when I was at school so I tried drinking some milk which usually helps with my hunger cues but the restlessness is still there. \n\nI feel so trapped in my bed but I know if I start working it now will fuck up my sleep schedule for the rest of the week and I have school work that needs to be handed in soon, and I will aslo accidentally wake my boyfriend sjnce he is a lifht sleeper. I used to self harm but Ive managed to recover somewhat and now I only hurt myself maybe every 5 months, but this shit has triggered those horrible thoughts again in full. I just want to cut and hit myself again and my mind keeps showing me images even when I dont want to. \n\nMaybe I will go for a run. ",

        "selftext": "Sigh. Welp after 4 days of grueling cognitive assessments, and $1k, I got my results back. Diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive), major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, social phobia, and \u201cunspecified neurocognitive disorder\u201d (?), but not autism. I should have asked more questions about their diagnostic criteria before deciding to test with this group but alas. I trusted the recommendation too much. They used the ADOS-II as their dominant criteria, and I scored 5/11 when the criteria for ASD is met with a 7/11. It\u2019s basically just a behavioral assessment based on your assessor\u2019s observations of you. If I do have autism I am a high masker and that assessment doesn\u2019t seem to account for that at all. For example I definitely have \u201cexcessive interest in unusual or highly specific topics\u201d but I don\u2019t talk about it unless probed because I\u2019m embarrassed by my special interest. I also do struggle with eye contact but I\u2019ve learned to fake it by looking at peoples noses/eyebrows or slightly unfocusing my eyes. That\u2019s already 2 extra points lol. They also extensively documented my sensory and self reported social issues, but didn\u2019t really seem to take them into consideration or weigh them heavily, or really weigh the self-reported RAADS at all. Oh yeah and I got NO questions about my executive functioning. \n\nThey seem to want to explain most things away based on the fact that I have lots of symptoms of depression and anxiety, and recommended I seek counseling for that and medication for depression. But I have done both before and nothing worked (still was a barely functioning, burnt out mess) which is how I ended up with the idea I may be audhd. So it just feels like they\u2019re throwing me back to the beginning \n\nOn the bright side, I still got out what I primarily went in for, which was to be able to get accommodations for grad school and access to a potential medication route for my adhd if I ever need it. I also learned a lot about how my brain works and where my strengths and weaknesses lie from each individual test. For example my IQ is in the superior range but a lot of the other cognitive tests were weighted down by my processing speed, which is something I\u2019ve struggled with my entire academic career. Extra time accommodations will help me immensely. I plan to go over the results with my therapist (who specializes in late diagnosed/high-masking neurodivergence) and maybe it can still provide useful information in the work I do with her. \n\nI am just still disappointed. The people in my life don\u2019t understand autism very well and have a hard time believing I have it. And I was confident in my self-diagnosis for a while but now I\u2019m back to second guessing everything. Like do I even know what autism is??? Anyway, Ive been operating under the assumption that I am autistic with my therapist and the work I have been doing has greatly helped me begin to get out of my burnout. So I\u2019m just gonna keep doing what works. Hopefully my experience can at least help someone else in their decision to pursue a diagnosis, or feel less alone in their own lol.

        "selftext": "*Kinsley and Kimberly stand atop the Croft Icefalls, sick to their stomachs.*\n\n*Their friend Kynn has fallen, and they do not yet know her fate.*\n\n*The women peer over the edge, scared of what they might see at the base of the cliff.*\n\n*Would her smiling face be looking up at them? Would there be blood in the white snow below?*\n\n*Ever so slowly, the two women turned to look down at the scene below them.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFor a few agonizing seconds, which felt like hours, the two peered desperately through the swirling flurries of snow, and finally located two figures at the base of the icefall. Kimberly's stomach lurched as she saw unmistakable stains of red, vibrant against the white of the snow. Her vision swam and she staggered.\n\nAs she teetered on the verge of the cliff losing consciousness, Kinsley yanked her back to safety and settled her firmly on solid ground. Then Kinsley inched her way back to the edge and strained her eyes, begging in her heart to see her friend and her husband both alive and well.\n\nSwearing at the accursed weather, she lowered herself to the ground and peered over the edge of the icefall. As she squinted at the two figures in the snow below, she realised that some of the red she was seeing was actually Kivi's beanie! \n\nFocusing on the colours, she saw his beanie bobbing around, and she watched as a pop of yellow rise up from the ground - Kynn!\n\nThe red beanie and the yellow snowsuit hobbled together away from the base of the falls. The figure wearing the yellow snowsuit (Kynn) seemed to be bleeding heavily, but somehow not leaving any blood on the snow. Kinsley realised that the red was Kivi's scarf, bound around Kynn's leg!\n\nHer heart soared in relief - Kynn and Kivi were clearly walking (or hobbling) away from the base of the icefall. Kynn was alright!!!\n\nLaughing in disbelief, Kinsley half-crawled over to Kimberly and grabbed her by the shoulders, tripping over her own words as she conveyed the wonderful news.\n\nKimberly was in shock from seeing her best friend's body in a pool of blood at the base of the cliff. It took several minutes for Kinsley to break through and make Kimberly understand that she had been wrong, Kynn was ok!\n\nWith the weather getting worse, the two women couldn't risk climbing back down the cliff, and so they retreated to a nearby cave to anxiously wait out the storm.\n\n\\*\n\nDown at the base of Croft Icefalls, Kivi was helping Kynn back to shelter. The base camp was too far behind them now, so he took her back to the big open space where they had stopped to cook lunch. He quickly set up a tent and bundled Kynn up against the cold. He relit the campfire, and hoped that Kinsley and Kimberly weren't foolish enough to try to climb down the cliff right now.\n\nThe storm wasn't so strong down here, but the Croft Icefalls were hidden by a thick thundersnow storm. Kivi shuddered to think what they might be facing at the top of the cliff. He turned his mind back to his current task - taking care of Kynn.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next morning, Kinsley accidentally rolled onto Kimberly and they both awoke with a start. \n\nThey were cold and their bodies ached from sleeping on the uncomfortable rocky floor.\n\nThe night before they'd thought about starting a fire, but decided not to risk it. The cave was small and cramped, and even ignoring the problem of ventilation, they were worried that they would catch fire in their sleep.\n\nThere was no room to put up a tent or any real kind of bedding, so they had climbed into their sleeping bags, fully clothed in their snow gear - though it hadn't done much to soften the feeling of the rocks which poked into them all night.\n\nNow that they were awake, they were keen to get back to their friends.\n\nThey cautiously poked their heads outside of the ice cave, revealing clear skies - a sharp contrast to yesterday's ferocious storm.\n\nStretching out their aching limbs, the two began making their way back to the icefalls. As they grew closer they picked up their pace, worry growing in their minds. But as the little path turned, they saw Kivi and Kynn appearing over the top of the icefall!\n\nKynn had injured her leg, but after a good night's rest and a nice hot meal or two, she was completely recovered! She and Kivi had taken advantage of the clear weather to join them before they came down looking for them. Kynn announced that she felt better than ever, and couldn't wait to see the view from the mountain top!\n\n*\\*Even though Kynn reassured her friends, her leg was twinging painfully. She didn't know it yet, but for the rest of her life she would experience phantom pains in that leg - especially when a storm was brewing.\\**\n\nThe four friends laughed and embraced, but decided to hold off on really celebrating until they had reached the summit. They trekked for a few more hours, and finally found themselves standing in front of a gigantic wooden torii.\n\nAt the very peak of Mt. Komorebi there was an ancient shrine. The locals would bring flowers and fruit as offerings, though the journey here was dangerous. They believed it was the only way to keep the \"dragon\" satisfied and prevent another volcanic eruption. \n\nThey had made other additions to the area, including a basic cabin for mountaineers to shelter in, and a large board filled with wooden pegs. When you reached the summit, you would write your name and a wish on one of these pegs, and hang it on the board.\n\nThis was the proof they would need to show they made it to the top. Each of them took one of the pegs and marked their name, and a wish, on it, before hanging it amongst the others on the board. Each of them came away feeling a sense of hope and fulfillment, except for Kimberly who was inexplicably gripped by a pessimistic belief that her wish would not come true.\n\nThey stepped away, feeling the relief and exhilaration of success.\n\nUntil this moment, none of them had even noticed the breathtaking views which surrounded them. But now the sun was setting and they stood in silent reverence, taking in the beauty of this alpine world.\n\nThe mountaintop was an island floating on a sea of fluffy clouds, now painted by the glow of the setting sun. The sky was streaked with the vibrant colours and intricate patterns which only Mother Nature can create.\n\nShe is an artist without peer.\n\nThey spent the night in the cabin, and decided to rest for another day before heading down the mountain.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBack down at sea level, cogs were turning.\n\nWhile they had been learning the culture and making an impression on the citizens, Council Member Ito had been working from inside the political system. He had instigated an \"Investigation into the impact of Weather Machine use, and potential side effects such use may have on third parties.\" The results of the investigation enabled him to draw the issue into public debate, and raise awareness of Henford's plight. \n\nAs such, most of the locals had strong opinions, and the weather machines (and their impact on Henford) were the subject of the day. Any conversation which touched on politics would, sooner or later, become a heated debate over \"the Weather Machine\" issue.\n\nThe locals were not split between those who wanted to save Henford and those who wanted it to suffer - they were divided between those who believed there was a problem and those who thought it was all made up. \n\n\\*\n\nThe cat sims had also been busy. They had immediately realised the value of opening up travel with Mt. Komorebi. \n\nThe sailors envisioned bringing their kittens here to frolic in the snow, and had already managed to figure out a bartering system with many local merchants - filling their bags with souvenirs for loved ones back home. They found the local ways of preparing seafood to be revolutionary and creative, and desperately wanted to bring the cuisine back to Brindleton Bay.\n\nHowever, due to their trouble learning the strict social etiquette of the town, the cat-sims found their negotiations failing. Everything went fine as long as the cat-sims were making small talk, or making a purchase, but as soon as they steered the conversation towards business, the merchants would abruptly excuse themselves or show the cat-sims out.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt was a clear night, and our expert mountaineers were soaking in the hot springs, observing the starry sky above.\n\nTheir successful summit of Mt. Komorebi had been confirmed, and Council Member Ito had invited them to the Onsen Bathhouse to discuss the next step. \n\nHe assured them that the locals thought very highly of them now, and would be more receptive to personal persuasion on the Weather Machine issue. He informed them of the actions he had taken, and gave them a strategically selected list of locals, who would have the most impact. If they could convince these people to support them, he said, then others would follow and they would almost certainly achieve a majority vote.\n\nOnce they had convinced enough locals, they should get word to him and he would call for a public vote - a public vote would be the only way to get quick results. Otherwise the politicians would argue about it for years and never make a decision.\n\nCatptain Nekolaj gave a wry laugh. As representative of the cat-sims, his presence was valued in any such discussions. His whiskers twitched in amusement.\n\n\"Always the politicians - they are waiting for some body else to do first. They are saying 'Oh no I will not be jumping in to this water, unless you are jumping in first!'\" He held up his hands, imitating someone backing down.\n\nCouncil Member Ito nodded sagely \"Yes, and then when someone else does jump first-\"\n\n\"Then the politician is saying that they are first one being in the waters!\" Catptain Nekolaj finished, with quite some animation.\n\nThe weaseling nature of politicians aside, our heroes felt confident that they could convince the common people to do the right thing.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next morning they had breakfasted and dressed in their best Mt. Komorebi fashions. Then they put their plan into action and set out to convince the people of Mt. Komorebi to save Henford.\n\nWhile some were easy to convince, especially with Kinsley recounting her first-hand experience of the Eternal Storm in Henford, they still had to contend with suspicion, conspiracy theories, and stupidity.\n\n\"If there was an issue 200 years ago why are we only hearing about it now?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't believe any of that for a second. It's obviously just a political ploy by Ito to further his own political career.\"\n\n\"If the situation is as bad as they say, and it's really been going on for so long, then how would there be anyone left there to complain? At this point it would simply be the natural state of things.\"\n\nThey appealed to their humanity, economic considerations, and sense of exploration.\n\n\"An entire country, trapped underground. Kinsley was the only one able to reach the surface, and hasn't seen her family in more than a year!\"\n\n\"With the seas safe to travel, the cat-sims will come, bringing exciting new trade opportunities and a great deal of tourism - not only will you increase your customer base and boost your sales, but a passenger trade route would open up franchise opportunities! Old Cattiana in Tartosa started up a franchise in Windenburg, under the control of her granddaughter, and saw a 3x return on her investment!\"\n\n\"With the storm cleared up, you'll be able to travel freely and see the world! Imagine yourself sunbathing on the tropical beaches of Sulani, or picnicking among the historical ruins of Windenburg! You haven't lived until you've eaten halo-halo while watching the sunset in Tartosa!\"\n\nAfter a week of heavy campaigning and schmoozing, the group felt they had done all they could, and sent word to Council Member Ito. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next morning the news reporters were all speculating on the public vote, which they announced would take place that afternoon.\n\nThough the politicians may drag their heels, the political system in Mt. Komorebi works fast once something has been decided. In the case of a public vote, the citizens are all given a half day to attend the Council Chambers if they wish. However they could still vote from the comfort of their home, or the ski slopes, or where ever else they happened to be at midday when the voting period opened.\n\nThey'd learned about it at the science centre; every electronic device in Mt. Komorebi was connected to the national government network. When there was a warning, or a public vote was called, every device in the country would switch over to the Official Channel. Citizens could review all relevant information for a vote, and then cast their vote right there from their phone, or tv, or smartglasses.\n\nThe voting period would be open for 6hrs, and in that time information and a televised debate would be accessible - to help voters make an informed choice.\n\nKinsley thought that was quite a good idea, as she believed it would take at least several hours just to get a grip on the actual subject of the vote. The titles of public votes all seemed to be very long and wordy, as though they had neglected coherency in their efforts to be accurate.\n\nToday's vote was titled: \"Proposed cessation of Weather Machine use under conditions where such use could potentially impact non-consenting third parties in a manner considered negative, contingent on perceived harm by a discretionary board to be formed in the event of a successful passing of this proposal.\"\n\nShe knew all about this topic and had played a large part in bringing it forward to the public vote, but even as she read the title, she began to feel confused. She knew this vote was about stopping the weather machines and returning natural order to the weather surrounding Mt. Komorebi (and affecting Henford-on-Bagley)... But the wording was so confusing that she began to doubt her own knowledge.\n\nStill, they were reasonably confident in their success - some more than others. Kinsley was sure that her family's predicament would spark a sense of moral outrage, leading voters to forgo their own comfort for the lives and wellbeing of others. Kimberly, a student of history, was pessimistic. She knew that historically it was rare for anyone to take action on behalf of complete strangers, especially if it involved any personal sacrifice on their own part.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAs midday approached, the group waited to enter the Council Chambers. They were keen to watch the legal system in action.\n\nCouncil Members and other officials would hold a debate in the Hearing Room, calling forth all interested parties to put forward their arguments and any evidence to support them. The council would remain in session for the full 6 hours, and at the end of the voting session the result would be tallied. It would usually take about 3.5 seconds, and then the results would be displayed on the Official Channel. As a formality the head of the council government would make a declaration confirming the results and any subsequent changes to the law would go into effect.\n\nTo keep it exciting for viewers, a large screen displayed the current tally at any given moment - one bar for \"yes\" votes, one bar for \"no\" votes. There was also one bar for \"I don't care\" votes, which were not counted in the final tally. Citizens were also allowed to change their votes as many times as they wanted, so the bars would often swing wildly when someone was making an exciting presentation in the Hearing Room.\n\nAnd of course, though voting was compulsory, citizens were rewarded for their diligence. They received tickets for performing certain actions - voting earned you one ticket, watching the livefeed from the Hearing Room earned you 5 tickets every half hour. etc etc. The tickets could be exchanged for all sorts of goodies at the Council Prize Booth.\n\nThe crowd filtered into the Hearing Room in an orderly fashion and settled themselves in the rows of viewer seating. Over the next four hours there was a steady flow of presentations, both for and against turning off the weather machines. Although only citizens could present arguments, Kinsley had been called to give a victim statement, and Kivi and Catptain Nekolaj were both called to make witness statements regarding the storm itself.\n\nWhen the voting period had started, 98% of voters had immediately voted. \n\nCitizens would typically vote as soon as the polls were open, though few of them would stick by their initial vote. In fact it was quite common for the younger generation to initially vote \"I don't care\" - just to make sure they wouldn't face punishment if they forgot to vote properly later on.\n\nBut even the youngest voters would usually tune in to watch the debate throughout the day, changing their vote as they made up their minds. And that was clearly the case today, as Kinsley and the gang watched the votes changing with every persuasive argument made.\n\nWhen Kinsley had been brought forward to give her firsthand account of the storm, and the suffering of her family, the votes had swung to over 80% in their favour. But now they had just as dramatically swung in the opposite direction, as an influential business man began fearmongering, claiming that the storm might be the only thing preventing other countries from invading them.\n\nThe last hour of voting had just begun, and the votes were not looking favourable. \"Yes\" and \"No\" were pretty evenly split, but the majority of voters had switched back to \"I don't care\" - indicating that they were torn between the two choices.\n\nThe Hearing Room doors were suddenly flung open in an extremely dramatic fashion, and a huge robed figure stormed in. Everyone turned in an idle response to the commotion, but they soon began gasping and climbing on top of their seats to get a good look at the intruder.\n\nHe stalked heavily to the centre floor, with security guards hanging from his arms - their attempts to eject him were clearly futile. One outraged council member was on his feet, shouting that only Mt. Komorebi citizens could stand before the council!\n\nThrowing the clinging security guards off of him, he stood straight and proud. \n\nTheir view now unobstructed, Kinsley and the others realised why everyone was making such a big hullabaloo - the man was Father Winter!\n\nFather Winter stood before the council and declared that he was a citizen. His family had been living underground ever since the volcanic eruption buried them. He told them that he didn't usually meddle in the lives of mortals, but he could not stand by and watch this atrocity.\n\nHe roared at the council, heaping shame on their ancestors who built a town over their trapped citizens instead of working harder to free them.\n\nHe turned on the crowd and cameras, demanding to know how they dared make that same choice again - leaving innocent people buried alive, when they could be saved?\n\nHis righteous fury was so intense that the entire room quailed beneath it. \n\nAll across Mt. Komorebi citizens were stopping everything to tune in. The screen in the room showed the votes draining away from the opposition and the undecided. By the time the voting period ended, Father Winter was still scolding the council, and the citizens.\n\nThe votes were tallied: 100% in favour of turning off the weather machines!\n\nIt was the first unanimous vote in Mt. Komorebi history.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfter the excitement of the vote, the group remained in Mt. Komorebi a little longer. The weather machines had immediately been turned off, but they needed to be sure that the problem would be fixed. That Henford-on-Bagley would actually be safe now.\n\nThey enlisted the help of the researchers at the Science Centre, and soon enough they were getting readings indicating that the \"Eternal Storm\" was dispersing and dying out. At the current rate, the seas would be safe to sail within a few days - but they recommended waiting at least a fortnight before trying to traverse that area of the ocean. Without the artificially created storm, the weather would return to it's wild state. And since no one alive had ever seen that area before the storm, they had no idea what sort of natural weather patterns they could expect there.\n\nThroughout Mt. Komorebi they were already seeing signs of change. The lower parts of the country began to see a dramatic drop in temperature. Areas which were already snowy were now experiencing sudden storms, with much heavier snow and sleet. The higher areas of town were seeing their first blizzards in centuries.\n\nThe school had their first \"snow day\", giving the children an unexpected day of freedom. Festivals had to be rescheduled or even cancelled due to the weather. The ski slopes were no longer open 24/7 with the perfect fresh powder they had once enjoyed.\n\nThe citizens were handling things fairly well, despite this sudden upset to their cozy existence.\n\nThe uncontrolled weather was affecting their lives, their businesses, and their recreation, but they found ways to enjoy those miserable days when they were trapped inside.\n\nThey learned the satisfaction of a hot bath after trekking home through unrepenting sleet. They learned the pleasure of gathering around the kotatsu, enjoying hot pot while watching snow fall outside. They learned how enjoyable it was to curl up with a book in front of the fireplace, while a blizzard storms around you.\n\n\\*\n\nDuring one such blizzard, Kinsley and her group found themselves trapped in their rental accommodation for over a week. \n\nThey had been staying in this smarthome since they arrived, but until now they had never fully appreciated it's capabilities. Power, water, internet, everything worked perfectly no matter what the weather was doing. Their fridge somehow always had fresh ingredients, though they had no idea how the supplies were getting through. Everything was controlled perfectly by the smarthome - the temperature, the fireplaces, the music and the lights. Everything.\n\nThough they were unable to leave the house, they had everything they needed to survive indefinitely. And thanks to the robust electrical grid & impressive smarthomes, they weren't completely isolated from the outside world.\n\nKimberly was frequently in contact with the Science Centre, continuing work on her secret project, while also getting updates on the weather situation. The researchers believed that the extremes they were currently experiencing (such as a week-long blizzard) were a sort of pendulum effect caused by turning off the weather machines. They were confident that the \"pendulum\" would swing back, and eventually the weather would stabilise.\n\n\\*\n\nDuring this time they got to know Father Winter a bit more. He could freely travel between fireplaces, so while he continued living in his family home underground, he often stopped by for a visit. His name was Krampus Winters, and he told them all about his family.\n\nLike them, his family had been forced underground by an apocalyptic event. His great-great-something-grandma had been trapped alone under the lava and ash, and had eventually met and married Father Winter. Each generation of his family had followed suit, finding love with a new Father Winter. They had lived quite happily underground for ten generations. However, when he was born his parents had decided to make a drastic change. They had trained him from birth to be the next Father Winter, so that he would be free to leave via the fireplace. He hadn't always appreciated how hard the decision was for them, and had sometimes resented his parents and his aunt for forcing this life on him.\n\nBut now he had begun to enjoy his role as Father Winter, and certainly enjoyed being able to travel back home anytime he wanted - though he did sometimes have nightmares in which he lost his ability to travel through fireplaces and became trapped underground, alone.\n\nIt was a terrifying thought, and certainly didn't help the group's morale. In fact, most of their time was spent trying to ignore fears like that.\n\nThey would chat, brush up on skills, cook extravagant meals for no reason. Anything to keep themselves occupied. Finally one day Kivi lit upon the perfect solution - he would teach them all how to knit.\n\nAt first there were some struggles, but soon enough they were all click-clacking away, knitting blankets and beanies and anything they could think of!\n\nLumi took a long time to learn, but eventually she made a very nice little doll which she took great pride in.\n\nKinsley knitted a somewhat wonky snowsuit for Lumi, which ended up being far too small. \n\nKimberly made some.... things... that she insisted were mittens. To be fair, they were \\*almost\\* mitten shaped - if you turned your head and squinted.\n\nKynn knitted herself a truly wild woolen lingerie set. (We won't discuss this further.)\n\nKivi knitted a special sweater/beanie/scarf thing for Drone-Kun, to help keep him dry and functional in light snow. Kynn hadn't been able to use him if it was snowing even slightly, for fear of damaging him. So she'd been mostly making videos, taking photos, & writing blog posts instead of streaming.\n\nIt was good to keep their minds and hands busy, and it was never a bad idea to have more warm clothes and blankets in a blizzard!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFinally the blizzard was over, the weather was stabilized, Catptain Nekolaj had entered an agreement for trade and tourism, and the sea between Mt. Komorebi and Henford was declared safe for sailing.\n\nHowever, the narrator decided something else should go wrong at this point, and so, shortly before they were scheduled to leave Mt. Komorebi, a sickness spread through the group.\n\nThe symptoms seemed wild and unpredictable - headaches, fatigue, nausea, some were experiencing a loss of appetite, others were hungrier than they'd ever been before. Some were seeing spots, some were covered in stripes, and Kinsley was experiencing a strange bloating.\n\nIt was when Kinsley began craving pineapple in her spaghetti that she realised that this wasn't part of the sickness - she was pregnant! The symptoms were exactly the same as her first pregnancy.\n\nAs she separated her pregnancy symptoms from the sickness the others were experiencing, she was perplexed. Her own symptoms now made sense, and Kivi's odd symptoms were explained by Couvade syndrome (or \"sympathetic pregnancy\" syndrome). But there was one other who was experiencing these symptoms - Kynn.\n\nKinsley engineered an excuse to be alone with Kynn, and delicately asked her if she could be pregnant. Kynn's eyes widened and panic began to build in her face.\n\nKynn knew how babies were made, and always practiced safe woohoo, but after a quick pregnancy test it became apparent that her precautions had failed. The sickness had camouflaged her symptoms, and since she had no experience with pregnancy she hadn't put two and two together.\n\nThe two women had a heart to heart talk, joined after a time by Kivi. In the end the couple had agreed to raise Kynn's child as their own. When the others returned from an afternoon of snowy fun, Kinsley and Kynn shared their big news!\n\nKynn didn't hide the fact that she was pregnant from the others, but she didn't want it to become common knowledge. She didn't know who the other parent was, so the choice was hers and hers alone. And she didn't want to deal with the possible judgement she might face because of her choice to continue adventuring instead of raising the child. It simply wasn't anyone else's business.\n\nThe friends held a little feast to celebrate the pregnancies. No judgement, just love.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen the day came to ship out, they agreed to meet at the docks. Everyone had \"one last\" thing to do, or \"one last\" person to say goodbye to.\n\nKrampus came to see them off, and promised to come visit them when they arrived in Henford-on-Bagley. Kynn was mobbed by fans asking for one last selfie or autograph. Kimberly was patting her thick suitcase, pleased with the progress she'd made on her \"little project\". It seemed as though Lumi was farewelling every single child from her school individually, with many embraces and dramatic tears.\n\nFinally they were underway.\n\n# To be continued...\n\n",

        "selftext": "I had my daughter about two months ago, she was a preemie. I always felt awful during pregnancy because I didn\u2019t feel that instant happiness every time someone spoke about me being a mom and carrying a child. I always felt uncomfortable or anxious. As if I was already setting myself up for failure. I was always envious of how my partner carried more for the baby rather than me. He is a great dad without a doubt but he is not good to me. So I hold resentment towards him. He didn\u2019t take care of me at the hospital, I had an emergency c section and had to shower by myself or ask my mother for help. Close to every argument we had he involved his family and it made me more upset. I have always voiced to him that I didn\u2019t like him doing that but he always goes running to his mother or sister with any argument we have. He complained to his sister that I didn\u2019t hold myself accountable to pumping every couple hours and he had to help me during the first weeks that I was discharged from the hospital. My whole pregnancy I worked full time at a daycare. I always came home tired and sick from the children.\nI mentally and physically was tired and I find that valid. So yes I did need some help. I feel crazy for thinking he would\u2019ve been supportive\u2026\n\nThere are so many things that have occurred during my pregnancy and postpartum. I lost my father before I delivered my baby\u2026 the only true person I ever had a bond with. I think this event started a bit of my feelings of depression.\n\nRecently I have been medically diagnosed with ppd, I denied it until I couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to have that, in a way making it true made me feel more of a terrible person. \n\nI hate myself everyday and I hate how I don\u2019t have a bond with my daughter. I hate waking up everyday and I hate that I had to go back to work so soon. I hate my life and I wish that I never met my partner. I wish that I wasn\u2019t here anymore. I feel dead inside. ",

I used to love artists like telepath, windows96, mount shrine (Lindsheaven Virtual Plaza), etc but now I can\u2019t listen to them anymore. I just tear up and get emotional. Vaporwave just gives me this super lonely feeling now. It\u2019s like becoming a hermit and living by yourself next to a very old natural structure like a sand mountain in a vast desert or something if that makes sense. It\u2019s like revisiting remnants of my childhood and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to enjoy this music again without it just taking me back and making me emotional. I think it\u2019s also because a lot of vaporwave artists have like dropped out of the vaporwave scene or passed away and were not getting new uploads from the vaporwave legends. Damn. Is Vapor Memory dead? In their bio it says 2010-2024. Are we cooked?\n\n",

My real passion is music or writing scripts and novels but it's nearly impossible to make a career out of those things.\n\nI took some Ui/Ux and cybersecurity courses. Cybersecurity was fun but it's a big field that i have no time to study.  As i'm working in 2 places to get a good income so i barely have time to myself. \nAlso it's really hard to start from scratch when you have a family to support. \n\nMy work places suck as well, I have no paid days off, So last vacation i took was about 2 years ago. \nSo life is really tiring and i feel so burnt out. I'm so depressed and i feel like i'm wasting my life in the wrong country and the wrong profession. \n\nNo need to mention the bad economy here in Egypt recently. As inflation is going beyond craziness and no clear indication of good future. So it's really depressing to feel that you are working so hard to just stay in your place.\n\nWhat should i do? \n\nShould i invest time in things i love hoping that one day i would be in a career i love? \n\nShould i be more realistic , suck it up and just keep running in this hamster wheel till i collapse and die? \n\nShould i seek living in another country, leave my home, friends and family behind and start a whole new life from scratch? \n\nI don't know what is the right thing to do here.",

        "title": "AITA for how I left my color guard team?",
        "selftext": "TW: breif mentions of suicidal thoughts and attempted SH\n\nThis is going to be a super long one and have a lot of background info and people so I'll try to keep this as organized as possible.\n\nThe main people involved are me (14-15F when this all occurred),  the guard director who we'll call Purple (mid 30s F), Lucy and Sally (both my age), and the band director, Patty (40ish M). All other people mentioned will most likely be my age unless otherwise stated.\n\nFor a little background, I joined color guard (we throw flags with the band and have our own comps, super awesome sport, highly recommend) freshman year (2023-2024) and right off the bat things were a bit amiss. Also to note, I have severe depression and anxiety, and also have ADHD, which hinders my ability to learn as quickly as other people (The ADHD was undiagnosed at the time but was very clear I had it). I was very upfront with Patty, Purple and the girls about this and they all seemed to understand and were willing to accommodate (at least the girls were). Also to note, Purple is the CG director at another school (and actually employed there) and our team is her little pity project. There's about 12-14 of us and her other guard is like 3 teams of like 25-30 and their school gets a shit ton of money. Purple is mostly with her main school so most of this occurs late Aug-Nov. of last year.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with HS marching band, we start in July and go on until football season is over in November (evil ik), and Purple wasn't with us until school started in August. Summer band was amazing, the problems didn't occur until Purple was coaching us more frequently. The best way to explain her teaching style is subdued Abby Lee Miller from Dance Moms (she kind of looks like her too lol). I told her straight up that her teaching style would be a problem with all my mental health issues (also I start crying if people raise their voice at me). Purple understood and would try to accommodate (obviously didn't happen). Overall, the atmosphere got incredibly toxic among the members and I, they got more frustrated with me when I didn't pick up choreo fast enough, or forgot it, or spaced out, which was never an issue before. Purple started getting more snappy and yelled at me more often, which in turn made me cry, which made her more irritated, which made me cry harder. This happened almost everyday during morning practice and eventually the members got fed up of my \"antics\" as well. And the main member who dogged on me was Sally. Sally was like my best friend in guard and she helped me a lot during summer band. Her more aggressive behavior didn't begin until Purple came back.\n\nDear Redditors, you may be asking, why didn't you tell someone? Why did Patty not do anything? How did no one notice how Purple's behavior was affecting you? I told several people, many times, Patty is a great teacher but horribly incompetent in all other aspects, and only two people noticed the toll this was taking on me: Lucy and one of the captains who we'll call Mary (16F). Both have known me a long time. Mary was my friend back in elementary school and Lucy is one of my best friends from middle school and has seen and helped me throughout almost all of my mental health struggles. Lucy made sure to teach me choreo I didn't get  help me calm down during crying episodes and Mary tried to help with the \"admin\" side of things. At the worst of the drama, I was having panic attacks everyday, crying after almost every practice, going home early all the time, skipping practice due to the anxiety (which didn't help my already kind of crumbling relationship with the team) and caused my grades to slip. \nFor a more context, American school sports is run by an organization called UIL. UIL also runs marching band comps as it's considered a sport. The rules state that you must be passing all classes in order to perform at football games and competitions. Because my grades were slipping below 70 I couldn't perform, making the members even more upset with me. Towards the end of the season I became extremely withdrawn and I started contemplating wanting to die and tried cutting myself with kiddie scissors.\n\nFinally, the season was over, I said over my dead body am I doing winterguard (Purple runs the entire freaking thing) and left amicably.\nAfter that, I made up with Sally and a couple others, I hung out with them, went to some of their performances and talked out all of the issues I had with marching season.\n\nFast forward to end of the school year and I decide to rejoin guard. I start summer band and immediately realize despite all the heartfelt talks and promises to do better the same bullshit starts up again. Also around this time the captains found some of my old tiktoks of me trashing guard and told Patty. Patty told my mom, we had a meeting with him and the two subs for Purple (who I love and still talk to when I see them) and Paty was basically like \"we can't fire her, maybe try to adapt to her teaching style idk what to tell you\" and the subs were like \"you seemfine when we're there, sure the girls seem a little hostile but you do what you need to\"\nBy the end of the meeting both me and my mom were like screw y'all (not aloud) and I quit again.\nThe captains understood and so did the veterans (what we call returning members) except Sally. Sally stopped returning my texts, liking Insta posts and stories, and overall seemed to withdraw herself from me. Once school started I noticed the gap more and confronted her over Snapchat. Basically, Sally said that she didn't like how I trashed talked her friends and that if I knew I was just going to quit again I should've just not rejoined, and brought up an incident with a friend of ours as her reasons.\n\nA. I never trash talked the members, I trashed Purple and how the team's behavior hurt me\nB. I thought everyone understood all of my issues with last year and how to resolve them\nC. The situation with the friend didn't even involve Sally, me and the friend made up ages ago, and you aren't even friends with her anymore\n\nSally got like mad upset and said that she needs time to gather her thoughts and for now don't directly interact with her. I said okay and we left it at that. That was last October.\n\nNow, I kind of want to extend an olive branch to her and a few other members I was close to and fell out of touch with. AITA for how I left guard and how should I go about reconnecting with the members?",

It's sparked my desire to transform my Voge 300rr  into a powerful electric beast.\n\nHowever, this is my first time diving into such a project, and I have a ton of questions. I'm leaning towards a hub motor for its clean aesthetics, quiet operation, and the extra space it'll free up in the center for batteries and the controller. But I'm unsure which type of hub motor would be most suitable for my needs.\n\nI'm considering QSMotor and have already started discussions with them on Aliexpress. However, I'm overwhelmed by the sheer variety of options: 6000W, 8000W, 10000W, and beyond! I've noticed that some motors with lower wattage claim to achieve similar speeds as higher-wattage ones, so I'm confused about the real-world impact of wattage and voltage (72V vs. 96V). I know that 96V batteries are generally more expensive.\n\nI'm also debating whether it's a better idea to buy the cheapest electric motorcycle available and gradually upgrade its components. However, I'm really attached to the look of my Voge 300rr, which is why I'd prefer to convert it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1sbn5vdsr4re1.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36f63706164ef19a4648d5542c9cf12d9ea3212d\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any advice you can offer, especially considering my limited budget. I was thinking of purchasing the controller, speedometer, throttle, etc., first, followed by the motor, and finally the battery.\n\nAny insights, tips, or recommendations would be incredibly helpful!

He knows I\u2019m a very good worker and can pick up quickly on stuff and somehow actually got me in. I\u2019m only training and started about a week ago but I have basically zero experience. Plcs are what they look for the most in a new maintenance worker so I want to start learning it aside from work to try to get it faster. I\u2019m 19 and about to receive my associates in information systems in about 6 months. This job starts at 6 figures and it would be awesome to be making that much money early on and also get tons of experience. Currently they only have me checking inventory and organizing parts, help create work orders, ect. I guess the parts guy was backed up and wants me to help him before I start my official training. First they want me to get comfortable with valve manifolds so if anyone knows much about those, info on that would be great too. Specifically JBT valve manifolds. This is all very quick and overwhelming for me especially from making 35k a year to potentially 100k+. Any type of advice is welcome and thanks! Also feel free to ask any questions",

The pain\u2019s been excruciating and I have a very hard time eating or falling asleep because of all the meds&pain. Oxy def makes me drowsy but the sudden bursts of pain and stomach burn keeps me awake. I know it will get better eventually, I just went to my first post-op PT session and my quad\u2019s completely shut down. Time feels really slow and everything hurts my back because of being only the bed or trying to sit with some cushion back. My brother\u2019s in the city and has been with me for everything right from taking me to the surgery and getting me back home, taking me to PT. I am grateful that there\u2019s someone\u2019s who\u2019s more than willing and happy to help without hesitation but I still feel overwhelmed by all this. If anyone could tell some positive words/stories to help me keep myself together I\u2019d really appreciate it I think I could use them while I hang in here and work on myself one step at a time. People taking care of me having been nothing but positive although I an still unhappy feels like the pain is sucking life out of me. I used to be really active and go out everyday now I feel so lost sad and in pain. Even right now it hurts a lot. Its def a bit better than day 2-3 but I feel so tired and it hurts a lot that I am just so scared to keep going. Some words of encouragement or positive stories would be really appreciated. I have been trying so hard to distract myself but because of the pain I am not able to focus or do anything else, any tips around managing sleep helping distract myself, etc. would be helpful as well.",

I\u2019ve taken lots of tests and tried to self type but could never find my sure type. \n\nI wasn\u2019t raised with any religious input. My family are liberals so I was raised with those beliefs. But I was always interested in religion but never found myself becoming a true believer in any faith. I was bullied really badly growing up. When I was younger I was much more confident and social. But when I started being bullied I become more shy and reserved.\n\nI have struggled with Depression and Anxiety most of my life. I have been anti depressants and anxiety meds since I was 11.\n\nIf I spent an entire weekend by myself i think \nIt would be bad for me. I love my time alone but I still need people around me. When i am alone I get stuck in my head and i tend to overthink.\n\nI think my relationship with movement and my surroundings is average. I did dance for most of my life and was above average at it. But i also am clumsy and hurt my self.\n\nI\u2019m extremely curious. My whole childhood i just asked questions all the time and i still do. Im curious about how the world works and why people act the way they do. I\u2019m a big why instead of how person. \n\nI\u2019m good in leadership positions. I make sure \nWe are using our time wisely and getting a good end product. I\u2019m a big perfectionist so if something isn\u2019t perfect I become upset and bossy.\n\nI\u2019m sort of artistic. I love art and looking at art and learning about it. But when I sit down to draw it usually doesn\u2019t come naturally though. But i have made some pretty cool things.\n\nI\u2019m usually in the past or the future. I worry about the future and what will happen to me.  \nI also reminisce on the past. I say, \u201cremember when\u2026\u201d a lot. \n\nWhen someone asks me for help I usually look at the situation and what they are requesting. I ask my self, \u201cCan they do this themselves or do they just want me to do it for them\u201d. But with people I\u2019m not super close to it\u2019s easy to take advantage of me. In school I would always do everyone else\u2019s work because I wanted them to like me.\n\nI do need logical consistency in my life. If something doesn\u2019t match with what I think makes sense I get irritated. I\u2019ve gotten into arguments with people about it before.\n\nEfficiency and productivity are important to me. But I do have a tendency to be indecisive and push things off until the last minute.\n\nI do control others. When something needs done I will tell everyone what do so we can get it done well.\n\nI learn best by reading and seeing information. I\u2019m not very good at gaining information by listening. I struggle in environments where the teacher lets the class do what they want without any instruction. \n\nI\u2019m an average strategist. I can easily break up a task into many different tasks. But if it is a topic I don\u2019t not care about I will wing it.\n\nI fear failure and everyone hating me. I\u2019ve been afraid of abandonment since I was little. I\u2019m cautious and scared of everything. I will not do something just because I don\u2019t want to fail and people make fun of me.\n\nI do daydream a lot. I have lots of little interconnected dreams in my mind. When I daydream I\u2019m usually aware of what\u2019s happening around me. I can focus on two things at once.\n\nIt takes me a while to make a decision. My find is full of what ifs. I will break the rules if it is cause I care about.\n\nI\u2019m kind of resistant to change. If it\u2019s about the world I love change for the better. But if it\u2019s about me and my person life I\u2019m resistant to it.\n\nI\u2019m extremely stubborn and headstrong. I will argue a topic just because I don\u2019t want to be wrong. I will continue to do something just because someone else tells me not to. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "\nB - my best friend\nC - my cousin\n\nThe first 4 slides are PMs\nThe next are B, C, and I\u2019s groupchat\n\nTo start with some context: I\u2019ve been struggling pretty badly lately with some depression, and had made it a point to set a boundary (dont know if thats the right word) with going out so frequently and/or hopping onto game with my friends because I had been stretching myself thin trying to hang out with them, work, and handle school \n\nThat being said, my closest friends (my best friend and cousin) texted me one morning uninviting me from the group night out we were planning, because they thought it would be \u201cbetter for my mental state and for everyone to else to take a day\u201d - we were supposed to go out in 4 days\n\nI was really frustrated by this and had expressed that after they asked for my thoughts and feelings on this -AFTER  i had, they sent me the second reason i was uninvited. \nAnother girl in our friend group, who i havent seen in almost 4 months, expressed she had some uncomfortable moments with me and wasnt ready to talk about it yet. My best friend apparently knew this a week prior but had just gotten the green light to tell me.\n\nI dont want to downplay how she felt about being uncomfortable at all, but im just downright confused because she\u2019s never once spoken, texted, or given me any indication that she was uncomfortable until now. I know i can miss cues sometimes because im autistic, but any time we\u2019ve hung out its seemed like every interaction was reciprocated. \nThe worst thing we\u2019ve done, that I can think of, is we were all hanging out one Halloween night - all of us were pretty drunk - and we both looked at eachother and joked \u201coh my god are we about to kiss right now?\u201d - she then puckered her lips and leaned towards me, so i leaned towards her, our lips touched for barely even half a second - we both laughed about it and then carried on with the night.\n\nThats what our friendship has kind of been for the last three years. Jokingly flirting, nothing actually serious, just fake banter of like:\nHer:  \u201comg you look so cute\u201d \nMe: \u201cNo YOU\u201d\nHer: \u201cOmg stop..are we about to kiss\u201d\nMe: \u201cStoppp im blushing\u201d\n\nIf i had known she was uncomfortable with ANY of this i would stop on the spot and immediately apologize - i never ever want someone to experience the discomfort of being touched when you dont want to be, because i know how that feels\n\nWe\u2019ve been having some other issues so this is just compiling to a point but AIO for feeling hurt by this?\n\nAs a side note: im a little frustrated at B\u2019s alcohol comment because two days before this text, I had invited her to a concert with me and my partner and the first thing she does when she shows up is ask \u201cwhat are we doing to pregame\u201d, which i wasnt even initially planning on doing - but since she wanted to i got some stuff out for her and i - i didnt have much - and she made an offhanded comment that we were the worst pregame hosts\n\n(Had to reupload due to a name being in one of the photos)",

        "selftext": "Hi Reddit. \n\nFirst of all, this is about me (18M), and my twin sister (18F). It is also about my Dad, and my Mom, who recently passed away. \n\nIm not sure how to start this, but I need help in what to do, and what the right thing to do is. My sister and I have no one else to talk to about this, and im not sure if telling my dad is a good idea. \n\nAlso sorry if my sentences are a bit of an unfinished puzzle\n\nTo the point\u2014 my mom died due to cancer about a month ago. And my dad is terrible with finances. Meaning he is not smart with money, and has been in and out of debt a lot. \n\nWell, I used to have a blue flannel that I got at a garage sale with my mom. It also happened to fit my mom, so somehow she started wearing the flannel instead, and I was fine with that. \n\nToday, I went to her closet to take back my flannel, and I found $15k in cash in each of the 2 pockets. In total $30k. I have no idea where this would have come from. I didn\u2019t know who to tell, so I told my sister, because I felt like she was the only one who I could tell at the moment. \n\nWell, apparently my sister also found money in the pockets of a suit jacket thing (im not exactly sure what the item of clothing is called) which was also $30k in cash. The clothing item, was somthing that my mom would have given to my sister. My sister has borrowed it all the time for job interviews and college stuff, so she was going to do that again, but this time, found the $30k in it. \n\nAnyways\u2014- both of the clothes that we found, were clothes that we would have eventually been given from our mom anyways. \n\nMy sister and I have kept the money right now, and have not spent it, and we do not plan on spending it, because we have no idea what to do. \n\nWe feel like if we tell our dad, he will be very possibly stupid with it. For context, my dad is in his 60s, and has no retirement saved up, and is an alcoholic. He has been in giant credit card debit multiple times, and has used those (idk what they\u2019re called) things that if you qualify, your credit card debt gets paid off. Those plans. When I was in middle school, he was in like $20k of credit card debit but under a different name.\n\nAnyways, my sister and I feel like my mom would have put that money in those specific spots for a reason. Still, have no clue where the money came from.\n\nAnd we don\u2019t  know anyone that we could tell this to without our dad finding out. \n\nSo Reddit, what should we do, and are we doing the right or wrong thing? Im incredibly confused and have no idea what the heck to do about this. \n\nEdit: also my grandma was helping clean out the house today, and apparently she found $5k in an envelope between my mom\u2019s bed and the bed frame. My dad took that. ",

        "title": "Just got dumped over FaceTime for an 8 month relationship and wondering if I'm a bad person",
        "selftext": "(Reading time: 20-30 minutes)\n\nI will try to be as objective as possible in this post explaining the situation. It's made me feel like I'm a crazy person, that I'm the only sane and rational one, and I'm truly left wondering if I'm at fault or a bad person.\n\nIt was the best relationship either of us were ever in, though we both knew it was still toxic. We're both 25, now close to 26. We met on Bumble while she was down in my small town in the south helping her friend move in. She lives in a major city up north. We're like a mirror to each other, besides me prioritizing being logical and her prioritizing her emotions. We started as long-distance. At first I flew up there every other weekend plus days off usually, at maximum 5 weeks apart. Fairytale first date with immense chemistry and a kiss out of a movie, all that. We'd splurge on dates and buy things for each other, do whatever our hearts please on dates, we'd make each other laugh all the time. So many good memories with parades, aquarium trips, small dates, and more. She has a bunch of close guy friends but I realized after I moved to her city and met them all that they're strictly platonic, backed up by the fact that she's known them for years and never once prioritized their time over me, rarely seeing them in the first place, and never without me.\n\nOn our first date she humble-bragged about having cheated on all her past partners for upsetting her, but that she's changed and doesn't do that anymore because, after cheating on her last boyfriend of 3 months with her manager at that time (who I will call AN) and bragging about it to him he overdosed on fentanyl, she has his death date tattooed on her neck. This led to me asking to check her phone one night while I was visiting, and she obliged. Nothing bad up there. I would ask to check her phone once per visit to make sure I wasn't kidding myself until I moved up there, when she asked that I stop doing that, that I should trust her, and I agreed.\n\nI made what I feel is my only serious mistake in the relationship within the first month. We were walking down the sidewalk and a chick was really checking me out. After she's out of earshot I look at my girlfriend and say \"that chick just gave me fuck me eyes\", just blurted out to make conversation, no ill intentions. She informs me that this is actually a manipulative behavior to inflate my value and I agree, so she makes a rule I can't talk about other women like that.\n\nShe had posted me once to her social media, on her Instagram story, for National Boyfriend's Day, 3 months into the relationship. At that time I flew her out to Miami for a fancy vacation with a really nice hotel, cocktail yacht cruise with a sunset view of the skyline, a visit to the Seaquarium, good food, all that.\n\nA pause in the story: R is her longest friend, one she's had since Kindergarten, but she hasn't seen her in 8 years since she joined the military and moved down south. R is 26. When we were down in Miami, while we were eating at a nice restaurant, her friend R was going through a tough time in her life: she divorced her husband due to him being an alcoholic, and the nice house they had bought got hit by two hurricanes and was unlivable, so she was pretty much homeless while her kids stayed with his parents. She was in the bathroom talking about things I don't even want to put on Reddit, self-harming herself in a bathtub and threatening to do the most horrific things I've heard someone threaten to do to themselves. We stay at the table for 3 hours while I help her defuse the situation. So I helped R during a suicide attempt, but apparently she doesn't know that. I also asked about her all the time to my girlfriend to make sure she was doing okay.\n\nWhile we were snapping R, I noticed she had stopped snapping someone named C two weeks ago who I didn't recognize and never heard about. I ask her to go through the chat and she sent him a \"hey with rizz\" filter and her tongue out and hearts while she was at a wedding she was invited to before she met me. She said she accidentally sent that to him, and meant to send that to me, which I believe, since she was drunk and has severe ADHD, sometimes sending things to the wrong people. But she went with it for a few weeks, sending him more pictures with hearts around her head, doing intimate things with him that we do and being way more excited to talk to him than me with a lot more emojis. I forgave her because I hadn't seen her for a while and we were a month apart during long-distance so I guess she got lonely, and it took her another month or two to seem as excited to talk to me as she was to him, but I asked her to block him and she did, she hasn't spoken to him since, and we're past it.\n\nI also noticed AN sent her a dick pic and asked her to hook up, to which she replied with eyes emojis and said \"I can't I'm with somebody I really care about\", she blocked him as well.\n\n4 months in while we're still long-distance and we have a similar situation where her friend from an old workplace invited her out for sushi and she claimed he's gay so she went with him. She said she was surprised to find out he's actually bisexual and considered it a date, but still spoke with him for 5 hours and left to go back to her parent's house where she stays, which I have proof of. She kept all lines of communication open with him afterwards and would ignore when he asked about taking her out to NYC.\n\nShe has sexual trauma, hates sex and doing sexual favors, is anorgasmic (tried all sizes 3-9 in. with 20+ guys and all kinds of toys, nothing), and had sex with me on average once a month. I tried not to complain because I love her even though my ideal amount of sex is as much as possible. This caused problems with her past situationship, citing it was the main reason they broke up besides him being emotionally abusive. She told me I'm emotionally abusive when she dumped me.\n\nWeirdly enough, I had to block the guy who brutally sexually assaulted her and gave her that trauma off of her Snapchat when I was going through it one day while visiting because she was asking if she could hook up with his girlfriend, he asked if I have a schlong to fuck his girl with, and she left it on open. Weird. I told her she could sleep with any woman while we're together but still weird to me.\n\nI move up there 5 months in. Constant complaints about every little thing from her the first two weeks but it dies down.\n\nOur first major argument begins here. We had an amazing NYE, in my opinion. I told her that once and she didn't respond, so I assume she doesn't agree, but that's okay. I invited her to watch the ball drop in Times Square but she wanted local and I complied. We went to see our city's fireworks; though the Uber driver was 10 minutes late and we saw them for only three minutes, at least we saw them on the ride there in a warm car protected from the rain. Standing in the rain for 20 minutes waiting for another Uber was a different story, but we cuddled for warmth and shared one of her cigarettes she got from South Korea. We came back to my place, I ordered $100 of her favorite Asian food to share so she'd have plenty of leftovers, got drunk on Soju and watched our favorite show. We watched the ball drop on Hulu and kissed. Cuddled to sleep. Bliss. New Year's day was a different story. We had a lot of fun early in the day: we drove to the city's nicest park to play soccer with friends, I spent $100 on her at Target and got her a pink drink from Starbucks, and cooked her my favorite dish, shepherd's pie, with ingredients from the best butcher in my city, while she napped. I suddenly had an idea. Relaxing at my place could be dull, since we usually just cuddled, talked, played video games, and tried new food. Her friends that I'd met had made me feel really good in our interactions thus far. So, I had the idea that she could post that I cooked her shepherd's pie to her Snapchat story and, after we ate, we could see people saying things like \"Aw\" and sparking up conversation, for a bit of fun and feel-good before we slept. I had no ulterior motives, genuinely. So, I wake her up from her nap to tell her food is ready, and she comes to get it. I ask her to do me a favor before we eat though, and I ask that. She seems very hesitant. She gives me a disheartened \"okay\" and takes a video of the shepherd's pie and me giving a thumbs up and smiling. She captions it \"Chef \\\\\\[my name\\\\\\]\". I was hoping for something a bit more romantic, and perhaps I'm out of line for this, but I ask if she can caption it with something about her boyfriend cooking her shepherd's pie. She changes it to \"When he cooks you dinner\", and says \"I don't want to put that you're my boyfriend up there\". I'm about to give up and just tell her to forget it, not to post it, but I politely ask \"could you please say something like my boyfriend cooked me shepherd's pie?\" She angrily posts it, takes the food, and stomps off to eat without telling me thank you. I'm a bit taken aback, and go to eat with her. Now, she's usually not one to tell me thank you, but something seems different. I come in and tell her that I'm not sure why she's so upset about something so small, especially after all the fun we've been having the past two days and everything I've done. I walk past her to get napkins. I notice her furiously tapping away to someone on Snapchat, and see really negative stuff up there. We're very transparent with each other, so I ask what she's doing, and she said she's complaining about me to her friend R. I didn't know that she talks bad about me behind my back; she admits to talking to R whenever she doesn't like something I do instead of coming to me. I ask if I can see what she's talking about and she hands me the phone proudly. I can't remember verbatim what she told R, since it was admittedly a bit traumatic for me to see, but it was something along the lines of \"he's being super controlling, he asked me to do so and so and I didn't want to\". Okay, valid, I didn't know that I was being controlling. But R's response threw me for a loop. R tells her \"Girl... run, he sounds like a red flag. He sounds like all my exes lined up. You're in a toxic relationship, and I hate what this relationship is doing to you, as a friend. He's a narcissist for bringing up what you've done the past two days as a way to deflect and I don't feel safe with him meeting my kids\", then proceeds to send her pictures of her kids out of the blue to guilt trip her. I calm myself down for a minute. I tell her she needs to confront R. I tell her it's okay if she thinks I'm a toxic red flag, whatever, but calling me a narcissist and thinking I'm a harm to her children when the only problem I've had in this relationship I can perceive is an off-comment, with no physical element whatsoever, something I would never do, is out of line. She starts crying and says I don't want her to be her own person, then runs to the bathroom and sits in there for an hour. She takes it off of her story. She comes back and we eat the shepherd's pie while watching our favorite show, but at this point this and everything in the relationship is starting to weigh on me so I start crying. She feels a bit guilty and says thank you for the food, how did you do this, trying to talk about the show, etc. I don't let her know but I don't want to be close to her in that moment and feel really betrayed. I tell her the next morning when she needs to go back home that I feel weird since last night but I don't want to let it affect our relationship and I carry her bags to her car for her, kiss her and tell her I love her.\n\nSecond major argument: she asks me one day, \"would you still be in a relationship with me if I moved 3+ hours away for 2 or 3 years for college?\" At this point in the relationship we had only been together for 6 months so I told her no, obviously not, especially since a major reason I moved here to start a new life was to close the gap in our long-distance relationship and be close to her. She was profoundly upset at this response, telling me she believed this is what would happen, so I couldn't help but cry and she resented that I cried for some reason. She goes to every single one of her major friends, telling them what I said. Then proudly reports back that I'm a bad boyfriend for not doing that, because all her friends would do this. She told me it included R, E, and A, though there were a few more. Then, as I try to defend my perspective, which I see (and still see) as the only sane and reasonable one, with my therapist agreeing, she argues with me for 3 days straight over this, to the point where I'm exhausted and my lips are covered in cold sores from stress. This led to two moments that provided a lot of insight into this relationship for me. Firstly, after she came to my apartment that weekend, while we lied in bed cuddling I told her it was crazy that she argued with me for 3 days over that, that it traumatized me, and that she needs to stop telling R our relationship business, because, as it turns out, R's constant egging was the reason she went for 3 days, like she was using a jedi mind trick on her to vent her frustration with her own life into our relationship. She begins sobbing and tells me it's because of childhood trauma from not feeling heard, and that she'll stop telling R our relationship business. As far as I can tell she's upheld this, but I haven't been able to verify this, and honestly I feel after our most recent argument she probably backslid and ranted to her anyways. Secondly, very important, it made me realize something about E and A. If they tell her I'm a bad boyfriend for something as normal and reasonable as not wanting to spend 2-3 years of my life with a girlfriend who lives 3+ hours away when we've been together for only 6 months, it has cemented in my mind that they are nothing but yes men bar extreme cases, and I have had my own further proof from her recent outing with E.\n\nOur third major argument, the one that ended the relationship for her, stemmed from this joke I told the other day, this is what it was as accurately as I can remember, accompanied by my laughing face over Snapchat: \"i walked out of the barber shop at 4 pm and a homeless chick was out front, she saw me, her eyes lit up, she put her hair behind her ear, and said \"good morning\"\ud83d\ude02 i just said mornin\" The joke is that she told me good morning at 4 PM. I love to make my girlfriend laugh and I figured she would find this funny. 8 months into the relationship and things can feel stale over text, with the same type of texts every day, so I try to mix it up any way I can. Obviously I am not attracted to the woman for reasons I feel would be somewhat bigoted to share relating to hygiene and health due to her homelessness, this should not have to be said. She gets angry with me, reminding me of the moment from 8 months earlier when she made a rule about me not talking about other women \"in that way\". Apparently I broke this arbitrary, easy-to-forget rule by telling the joke, and she hammers me for doing it twice now. At this point I have my first strong emotional reaction to any of this besides crying in the relationship thus far. I FaceTime her and say \"what the fuck is wrong with you?\" She says she's at physical therapy (she was) and I say \"I don't give a fuck\" and she hangs up. I tell her that we haven't fought in two months, she's angry over a joke anyone else (hyperbole, most people, at least secure and rational people in my opinion) would find funny, aka nothing, and that she's stirring the pot for no good reason because she craves drama, something I've gotten on her about over and over.\n\nDays go by and I figure it was nothing, at least it was to me. I'm sitting at the counter working. My job asks me to generate 5 leads a day and the time is flexible, so sometimes I end up doing them until midnight. I told her this. She says she's going to play pool with E while she's visiting and I say okay. She gets back and one of the first things out of her mouth is \"I didn't invite you so I could talk about you to E\", to my surprise, since I thought she didn't invite me because she knew I had to get leads. This upsets me a bit so I ask her what she spoke about, she says \"stuff\". At that point I know she was talking negatively about me to E from her body language, and I'm angry, though keeping my inside voice and being rational as I am, so I press her to tell me what was said. Obviously she has the right not to tell me, but I press because I feel it was something I feel I should know since it could be sabotaging the relationship. She tells me (and there's no way to know the truth of all that was said) that she spoke about the argument we had over the joke and that she agrees with her take.\n\nWe go to my girlfriend's game that night where she invited E and A. She acts distant to me whenever we're with a friend, I noticed she gave me a half hug instead of full and asked me to sit in the car while her and E went inside Wawa on the way home later that night. I notice after the game that E is acting differently to me than before, from her actions and body language. Last time she saw me she couldn't stop talking to me and gave me a big hug bye. Now whenever she looks at me it's uneasy, and when I try to position myself to get close in case she want a hug she distances. I immediately congratulated her after the game on her performance and she ignored it twice, citing how horrible it was. I don't know what my girlfriend told her.\n\nI had politely and gently asked her three times to stop bringing our problems to her friends, stop sending them texts and weaponizing them against me. I told her if she continued to do this we would be in a negative feedback loop until her friends all hate me since she feeds them every one of our problems, painting me in a bad light without my side of the story, and using that as the main catalyst to end the relationship. Instead she could formulate her own opinions, place them against more neutral or blunt third-parties, and then think it out, instead of airing our dirty laundry to her entire inner circle constantly. I advised that if something is so major she feels it will end the relationship she can share it with her inner circle, but any ranting or venting should go to randoms I will never meet, not the people I'm expected to hang out with all the time. She refused.\n\nI also confessed to her that the only things I would change about the relationship are cutting R out of her life and stopping going to friends over small things. I told her I did wish she'd move in and split rent ASAP and we could work towards having a kid, but that I'd wait to not be selfish because I know she has her own goals.\n\nShe had a habit of telling me I'm crazy and that I need therapy when she's upset with me. When I finally went to therapy my therapist agreed with all of my \"crazy\" takes and told me I'm not the problem, she is. She has 30 years of experience with couple's counseling. Her therapist has no experience with couple's counseling and is mainly a nutritionist.\n\nI wake up to this text 8 months in: \"I would like to take a break from our relationship this weekend. I need time to re evaluate and think about out what\u2019s been going on with us. I would like some time till at least Tuesday to talk to my therapist about this. She has been on vacation and not available to talk to. Please do not come to my game tonight, or the bbq on Saturday. I can\u2019t stop you from going to pickup on Sunday but if you are going please let me know and I will skip it. I don\u2019t not want to talk and go back and forth about this. This is my decision I\u2019ve given a lot of thought to and I\u2019m not going to change my mind. Please respect my wishes.\"\n\nI give her her space. I send her Wednesday at 5 PM \"it's past tuesday what's the news\", she asks to give her a couple minute so she can get off work and she's going to FaceTime. She FaceTimes me in her car and says she made up her mind this weekend but procrastinated to share until today. She reads me off a speech clearly written by her friends about how we're not compatible and need to split ways and both work on ourselves, I call her out for it being written by her friends just like the text she sent me and she says it is but it's her decision. I tell her that we can continue the relationship, I just won't critique her or complain, the only reason I did that was because I wanted us both to be as comfortable as possible for the long-haul, even though we may have seen things differently since she said on our first date she has commitment issues and she's only looking for a few years, I thought I could change her mind. She says that's toxic and not being honest and we're both hurting ourselves by staying in the relationship, that I'm logical about everything and she's emotional about everything, that we tried for 8 months but it's just not working and I've hurt her feelings so bad with the joke situation and my outburst that she wants to end the relationship. She says she shared my side of the story, including parts of what I've wrote here, and everything with R, E, A, a guy named G who was my best friend since I moved here but I knew through her (she's known him a year longer), and her therapist. She says all but G said I'm emotionally abusive. Am I? G simply says that he sides with her and leaves the group chat on WhatsApp. I ask what everyone thought of the shepherd's pie situation (excluding G). She said that they all said I was being controlling, manipulative, and overstepping her boundaries, and her emotional response was valid because I was being too pushy. She says she was wrong about the college argument. She says that everyone said it's normal and healthy to bring problems to friends. I tried my best to explain to her that she weaponizes their opinions against me, that she made all the holes that sunk the ship by choosing R over me and weaponizing her friend's opinions against me and then asking me to hang out with them, she said nothing. I asked what they thought of the emotional cheating situation and no one mentioned anything about it. I said that tells me all I need to know, you're surrounded by yes men and enablers. I give her this advice: 1. don't highball and say you have sex every two weeks ideally, say you have sex once a month which is what I calculated, and be honest about not enjoying sex whatsoever and being anorgasmic as quick as makes sense to her next man, 2. I told her what I told you about the toxic cycle of weaponizing her friends against her boyfriend over every disagreement, that she needs a doormat or yes man, not someone that respects themselves, 3. not to cheat, and 4. to wait until she's figured out the rest of her life including whether she wants to move for college before hitting the dating scene because it looked like all she cared about to me was soccer and friends. She told me that she doesn't think there's anything wrong with me, that I have a good heart, just that we're toxic together, and I agreed somewhat. I told her I won't block her unless I see a guy on one of her social media stories or posts, that it would really fuck me up if she posted a guy to her Instagram because she only ever posted me to stories not a concrete post, but that I'll never block her phone number so we can communicate with each other in the future, that I won't blow up her phone number wanting her to take me back and shit, that I've already agreed and just want an open route of communication, she didn't say anything. I told her to come pick up all her stuff this weekend and she agreed. I told her \"I love you cheese girl\" and ended it with \"guess what\" and then hanging up, our inside joke.\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts, blunt or not, on this situation I would love to hear them.

Starting today I'm beginning to do what I need to do to get back on track in life but the sadness and regret of all the bad decisions I've been making these past 5 years is making me so sad and want to cry every second.

        "selftext": "Hi , so I went into work today and I was working with the girl who was with me when my manager was \"nodding\" . She let me know that yesterday (2 days after the incident) that he's been constantly nodding off over the past few days. On sunday after I left, she told me he was asleep / nodded in the office until around 6:00-7:00PM when our big boss came in (the entire stores manger of the restaurant and gas station) when she woke him up so he wouldn't get in trouble. After that he didn't nod off again that night to her knowledge. \n\nThe next 2 days however , are another story. She said on Monday he was \"nodding\" even more throughout the day and even noticed that his car had been freshly scraped on its side, almost like he was nodding off while driving and he scraped the side against something. What was also found was little bottles of alcohol . In and outside his car door. And you could tell it was fresh because there was still drops. \n\nOn tuesday, I got a text asking to come into work but I said no, simply because I didn't want to. But I found out that it was due to the manager calling in and saying that he got a \"flat tire\" on the way to open the store and that he'd be there soon only to not show up at all or tell anybody that he wasn't going to be showing up. So the store manager called someone in as he wasn't responding. That poor girl had to work 13-14 hours because he didn't show up. mind you since there's only 1 of us on the clock at a time usually, we don't get breaks. \n\nOn Monday and Tuesday , around 3-4 customers had come in and actively noticed him nodding off. 1 or 2 of them recorded him and they all complained about him and one even told a another coworker that they think he's on fentanyl.. They also told my store manager that as well. He says he's on a heart medication but i don't think a heart medication would cause you to act like that, especially when others are noticing.\n\nanyways, that's my update. lol\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi, Christians.\n\nI (26 F) struggle with being a Christian in theory, but not in practice. Let me explain...\n\nGrowing up, my family has always been spiritual but not religious. My parents prayed and talked about God and Jesus daily, but they didn't take me to Church frequently. My parents also exposed me to a decade of domestic violence. I didn't really feel like God and Jesus were present in my family home or protecting me at that time.\n\nEventually, my parents divorced and I moved to a different city. This is when my childhood trauma started to manifest as mental health problems. I also began exploring alternative lifestyles like feminism, homosexuality, and atheism. The ways I coped with my mental health problems and self-explored clashed with the Bible, so I distanced myself from God and Jesus.\n\nFast forward to now. Last fall, I started drinking daily and taking edibles every weekend to cope with my mental health problems and life. I got to rock bottom and realized that nothing could make me happy. So, I turned to God and Jesus and sobered up last winter before I became a full-on alcoholic.\n\nThe only problem is, every time I turn to God and Jesus, I end up falling off. My brain is wired to be a night owl, so waking up at 5 a.m. to read the Bible before work doesn't feel sustainable to me. However, by the time I come home from my exhausting job at a homeless shelter, I don't have the energy to read the Bible. I've tried going to Church, but I'm autistic and get really stressed in populated settings I'm not familiar with. For example, I visited a Catholic Church a few times and got really overwhelmed by the rituals I didn't know. Yet, watching Church online isn't stimulating enough for me.\n\nSince I struggle with reading the Bible and going to Church, I try to live out Biblical values, like loving thy neighbor. Even that is hard for me! I try to treat my work at a homeless shelter as ministry, but I see, hear, and experience so many horrible things there that it feels impossible not to think hateful thoughts. No matter how many Bible verses I mumble to myself throughout the day, I always end it feeling defeated.\n\nOne on hand, I feel like such a disappointment to God and Jesus. On the other hand, I'm trying to tell myself that I'm doing the best I can as a traumatized, mentally ill, neurodivergent person and that God and Jesus are happy to see me keep trying.\n\nTldr; The theory of Christianity helped me become sober, but the practice is so hard for me to maintain. **How do you fit the practices into your daily life as a working adult with mentally disabling conditions?**",

        "selftext": "Since I was around 12, I\u2019ve noticed that when my mom drinks, she becomes a completely different person. It\u2019s unpredictable- sometimes she drinks more, sometimes less- but on average, it\u2019s about three nights a week. When she does, it\u2019s like walking on eggshells. The smallest thing can set her off, and she becomes mean, manipulative, and aggressive.\n\nShe used to threaten to kick me out when I was younger. Now that I pay rent, she holds other things over my head\u2014like taking me off her car insurance or reminding me that my car is technically in her name. She constantly uses these things as leverage to control me.\n\nA few months ago, she had a serious medical issue that forced her to stop drinking and smoking for a while. I hate to say it, but that time was peaceful. But now that she\u2019s recovered, she\u2019s right back to her old ways. I\u2019ve tried warning her that drinking could make her condition worse, but she either denies it or says she doesn\u2019t care. She also refuses to admit she has a problem, so getting her to seek help is impossible.\n\nMy grandparents have been dealing with this for years and don\u2019t know what to do either. I\u2019m saving up to move out, but I\u2019m not there yet, so I feel stuck. If anyone has been in a similar situation and has advice- something I could say to her or do, that would make her realize and stop. I\u2019d really appreciate it. Please don\u2019t give advice if you don\u2019t have any experience with something like this.\n",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m (21M) in a really uncomfortable and confusing situation, and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m overreacting or if my suspicions are valid. I\u2019ve been dating my girlfriend, Jasmine (17F), for about a year now. She\u2019s funny, smart, and generally supportive. I have fetal alcohol syndrome, which has made things like memory and social interactions more difficult for me. I\u2019m not the most conventionally good-looking guy\u2014I\u2019m shorter, not in the best shape, and honestly, I\u2019ve always felt a bit insecure about how I look compared to other guys. But Jasmine has always told me she loves me for who I am, and I want to believe that.\n\nBut recently, I\u2019ve been feeling really uneasy about some things. The first time Jasmine met my dad, I noticed something that made me uncomfortable. My dad is in his 40s, tall, good-looking, and in great shape. He\u2019s the type of guy who attracts attention, especially from women. He\u2019s always been a \u201csilver fox,\u201d and I\u2019ve always felt a bit self-conscious because we look so different. I\u2019m definitely not as good-looking as he is, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve struggled with for a while.\n\nWhen Jasmine met my dad for the first time, her behavior was *way* too flirtatious. She was laughing a lot at his jokes, touching his arm, and just generally acting a little too interested in him. At first, I brushed it off, thinking maybe I was just being insecure. But over time, I started noticing other things that made me feel even worse.\n\nLately, Jasmine has been distant\u2014less affectionate, taking longer to reply to my texts, and just acting cold in general. I\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s been texting or calling my dad a lot more, even when I\u2019m around. The other day, I came home early and overheard them talking in the kitchen. They were laughing and chatting, and when I walked in, they immediately stopped talking. My dad quickly left the room, and Jasmine got quiet, almost like they were hiding something from me.\n\nBut what really set me off was something my dad said. A few weeks ago, we were all hanging out together, and my dad complimented Jasmine in a way that made me feel extremely uncomfortable. He called her \u201cbeautiful\u201d and even went as far as to say she looked \u201cangelic.\u201d It felt inappropriate, and Jasmine didn\u2019t seem bothered by it at all. She just smiled and laughed, almost as if it was a normal comment.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to respond at the time, but it felt really disrespectful\u2014not just to me, but also to Jasmine. I didn\u2019t think she should have accepted those comments so easily, especially since we\u2019ve been together for a year now. But when I tried to bring it up to Jasmine later, she just brushed me off. She said I was being paranoid and accused me of overthinking everything. She also told me I need to stop \u201creading too much into things,\u201d and that I was just jealous for no reason.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to talk to my dad about it, but he just laughs it off and says I\u2019m being ridiculous. He insists that he\u2019s just being friendly with her and that nothing\u2019s going on. But every time I try to address how uncomfortable I feel, Jasmine says I\u2019m just being insecure and that she loves me.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I feel like I\u2019m stuck in this situation where my girlfriend and my dad are both dismissing my feelings. I\u2019ve tried to be understanding, but I can\u2019t ignore how weird their interactions are, especially with the things my dad has said about her. I don\u2019t want to accuse anyone of anything without proof, but it feels like something\u2019s definitely off.\n\nSo, AITA for suspecting my girlfriend might be cheating on me with my dad, or am I just overreacting and being paranoid?",

I've been tasked by my manager to organise a team event on a VERY tight budget. I've recently started in this sector and have no idea how to appropriately and respectfully approach businesses to consider asking for some discounts / donations to support the sundowner. Are there businesses that collect up any goods that are out of date and distribute? How does Perth operate in this space? I don't want to come across as a tik tok influencer asking for free stuff like an entitled brat!!! \n\nSide note - The team here are used to a Christmas party as the annual event and thats it - it blows my mind, I came from mining where we celebrated the Chairpersons cat's groomers birthday. We are a health service and can't have alcohol onsite (nor can we afford to hire a space for an hour or two). I'd really like to show the team here that they are valued and give them something a bit fancier than a brand name lemonade. ",

I am 28 years old. \n\nIf anyone could keep me company today I really would appreciate it.\n\nMy favorite color is pink. I love listening to all kinds of music. Though my main preference is rock and metal. My favorite band is Ghost. If you end up with me you will have to deal with my addiction. (The band, not drugs or alcohol.)\n\nI am a plus size woman, I would say that I am on the smaller end of that spectrum. I know that I may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, so please just don\u2019t be disrespectful is all. I have been working on improving both my physical and mental health. It\u2019s always a constant battle.\n\nI would prefer a long term and genuine relationship. My age preference in men is 30+. I am looking for my best friend, my partner in crime, my Mickey to my Minnie. I am looking for someone that is genuine and loyal. Someone that isn\u2019t afraid to be goofy and silly.\n\nI eventually would like to settle down. I am only looking for something monogamous. I eventually would like to have children one day as well. I\u2019m not necessarily looking for someone that is local. I am okay with some distance, at least in the beginning anyway.\n\nI love going to theme parks, I love traveling, I love trying new things, I love to watch movies, and listen to music. I love Disney, Marvel, Harry Potter, and much more.\n\nIf you would be interested in getting to know me, don\u2019t be afraid to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you. I also apologize if I haven\u2019t responded back to you yet.

My social personality is completely paired with being the life of the party, the first one to drink and last one to stop\u2026. I\u2019m loose at parties, \u201ctrouble\u201d, fun, the wild one, extremely outgoing and funny.  \n\nThrough a couple month long bouts with sobriety I\u2019m realizing this isn\u2019t true.  I\u2019m actually much more intentional, curious and excited to get to know people deeper.  The pressure to quit is internal only, which sometimes makes it difficult.\n\nIt helps me to understand how I got here:\n\n12-15:  hung out in cool crowd, but super awkward around girls. Often got picked on at get together with my friends. \n\n15: introduced to alcohol.  First party I had 3 beers and puked under a pool table.  But POOF, I was no longer afraid of girls and felt a bit cooler\n\n15-18: high school days, hung out with the crowd that was always being drinks to parties. Felt like I was in the cool crowd, and no longer had anxiety about awkwardness around girls\n\n18-21: go to college, join hard drinking frat. I look back at this time and feel shame and embarrassment. Binge drinking to the point of blackout 2-3 times per week. Fights, random hook ups, dangerous behavior.\n\n21-28:  teach abroad, sober throughout week, blackout once per weekend, take all weekend to recover.  This trickled down a bit to maybe black out once every 2-3 weekends in late 20s\n\n28-36:  have a drink per night, sometimes a couple more.  Think about drinking way more.  Think about it being an issue way more. Restrain myself at company events and family/friend parties because it\u2019s no longer socially acceptable.  Blackout maybe 3-4x per year, but get more drunk than everyone else most party\u2019s.  \n\nThe amount of energy it takes to restrain myself is not worth it, takes away from the joy in everyday moments and spirituality.\n\nTherefore I QUIT",

        "selftext": "Bunch of random thoughts/comments/reviews from my first VV sailing last week (4 night Miami-Key West-Bimini-Miami). I've sailed several (7??) times on Disney that I will likely make some comparison comments to.\n\nFirst though, I want to thank everyone that answered questions I posted. It really helped to plan things out for a first timer on VV, and make sure GF had a great first cruise (and celebrated her 50th).\n\n  \nPort - I live in the Orlando area, and drove to the port. Miami traffic can suck, and did on the way home. I'd try to sail out of Ft Laud in the future if on VV. But sailing out of Port Canaveral (Disney) is so much easier for me.\n\nCabin - had a verandah on 13 forward. Cabin was fine - didn't mind the mattress (other than the height of the bed), bathroom/shower was fine. Little tight on space, but not bad for 2 people for 4 nights. Disney cabins feel a little more luxurious/appointed, but VV cabin was perfectly acceptable.\n\nSOR - did SOR mainly to get the earlier boarding time, and think the value was appropriate for the price. Attended the reception for a bit (nice effort, but ehhhh), the in-room treats were kinda gross, the shake for champagne went over well. Spent an hour and a half in the spa on the morning of Key West (not busy).\n\nFood - mixed bag. Overall I would say the food was \"fine\". I only received two dishes that were actually hot over 4 nights - the bread (DELICIOUS) and shrimp and grits at the wake. All of the other food was room temp. And most of the food seemed to lack much flavor, other than the steak at Extra Virgin (that had a nice kick). Also found pretty much every dessert item across the ship to lack much flavor. Had the pizza one afternoon - thought it was good (not the most topping options though). Had the Galley every morning and thought it was good (kinda hard to mess up breakfast). Had a couple other items for lunches (burger, panini, tacos) that were fine/good for a cruise. I think Disney's food is better overall.\n\nKey West - didn't think there would be much to do, so didn't get off ship until little before noon. Walked down to southernmost point (that actually isn't), Hemingway House, had some key lime pie, and walked Doral St (or whatever it's called). Ended up being a nice afternoon (weather was perfect).\n\nBimini - nice club, but was WAY crowded. It was a lot less busy after 2 when people started going back to the ship, which made it more enjoyable. Also, I could swear they have watered down drinks. I had 3 drinks in an hour and didn't taste any alcohol and felt nothing. I like Disney's adult beach better - much less busy and more relaxing since so many cruisers stay on the family beach with their kids.\n\n\"Vibe\" - I've read a lot of comments about the vibe on VV. It definitely has a younger/hipper/party feel to it, which is appropriate for an adults only cruise. The parties were fun, the pool area was packed every day. We spent time at the Perch to try to avoid the crowds for some relaxation. One day they did Zumba with about 30 people there - not the most relaxing time (lol). Service was good, but not over the top like Disney.\n\nOverall, we had a really good trip and have no concerns with sailing VV again (and will). Disney might have a leg up on feeling a little more luxurious/service-oriented. But Disney is also at least 50+% more expensive a lot of the time. Yes, the kids are on Disney. But I think the adult-only spaces on Disney are nicer and more relaxing (since they're not so crowded). I'm happy to have tried non-Disney and had a good experience. I will probably still sail Disney occasionally in the future, but will also sail VV as long as the price is right.\n\nHappy to answer any questions/argue any of my thoughts. ",

        "selftext": "I (27F) have been with my boyfriend, Ashton (29M) for two years.    \n  \nFor some context, I'm a person with a past/baggage, whatever you wish to call it. I grew up with my alcoholic mother who loved to beat me and either destroy or take away anything that gave me joy, especially after dad left us. The one item I managed to keep out of her clutches was a silver charm bracelet that my dad gave me before he left when I was 6. He said it belonged to my grandmother and wanted me to have it. I was only 3 when my grandmother passed, so I don't remember her a lot, but I do remember a 'warmth', if that makes any sense. I latched onto it, and it became an item I could look at and feel comfort from.  \n   \nI finally ran away from my mom when I was 15, and stayed with my  best friend until I graduated and headed for college in another state. I haven't spoken to or seen my mother since, nor have I tried to find my dad. I left it all behind, except for the charm bracelet, which I take care of and wear every day. I got a job, a stable life, graduated college, and yes, got some therapy. I bounced between short. bad relationships until I met Ashton. He was very kind and understanding with me, and knows the bare basics of my past. I've left out the truly horrible stuff; just not ready to tell him yet. However, he knows how important the bracelet is to me. \n\nTwo days ago, we were just relaxing at his place, chilling out on the couch and watching some Netflix. I was playing with one of the charms on my bracelet, a habit of mine. Out of nowhere, he asked me, \"When are you going to finally get rid of that thing?\" I was dumbfounded and asked him what he meant. He said charm bracelets were things little girls wore, and that I was an adult, and that he didn't have an issue with it before because he thought I only wore it occasionally, not every day. I got upset immediately and said I was never getting rid of it, because it was important to me and he knew that. He called me ridiculous, said it was immature, and tried to grab it. I pulled out of his reach and off the couch. I yelled at him, told him to fuck off, and left.\n\nHe tried to call and text me, but I've blocked him. He came over twice, but I never answered the door. I know it sounds stupid, but I'm feeling like maybe I did overreact, and I'm really doubting myself. AITA for getting defensive about my charm bracelet?",

        "selftext": "Hello to whoever may read this,\nI\u2019m not sure if this style post is welcome, but I\u2019ve never shared my experience and feel as if I am ready. \n\nI\u2019m currently 24 years old, and for the last two years I\u2019ve been free of alcohol. Thinking back on the last 8 or so years 6 of those I drank and I should\u2019ve known the signs. In early high school when friends would drink I\u2019d drink until I puked. Without fail. \n\nFast forward a couple years I got to travel the world, and waste days shit faced rolling around the streets of cities I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever see again. As I turned 21 I was given a liter of grey goose this is where I felt the turning point. \n\nAfter a breakup I drank that bottle daily til it was gone, and went on to drink most days socially as apart of my lifestyle. I noticed myself start to drink at home on the off days because it was a habit, and tried to stop. This first period lasted 6 months and it was a trial period. I tried to restart and be in moderation but it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nAfter a short while longer of daily drinking I met a girl and found that distractions would reduce the drinking. And truthfully right up to when I stopped drinking I was not binge drinking, or drinking in an abusive manor I just decided I was done. \n\nThe sobriety led to a long overdue mental health collapse. A rough psychedelic trip the year finally hit me and all I could see was death, but I was sober. I realized in these times that I coped with drinking through relationships ending, and the unknown process of figuring out that trip gone wrong. With some therapy and time things got easier.\n\nNow I\u2019m two years removed I can\u2019t separate if sobriety is a necessary thing for me, or if my previous actions were in direct response to neglect in other areas of my life. \n\nI have considered drinking strictly wine or in certain situations only. It\u2019s been really hard after the psychedelic issues any substance has caused negative reactions (coffee, weed, edibles) all induce panic attacks. So it\u2019s easy to see alcohol being romantic. But why does life tempt you to have a substance as a vice? I work out daily, my work is fulfilling I occupy my time, but is it not enough?\n\nAnyways I apologize for the rant if it\u2019s un welcomed but I\u2019m trying to make sense of it all.\n\n- C",

        "title": "*sigh* I think my husband is an alcoholic...",
        "selftext": "Please be gentle with me on this because I am in no way trying to judge him or dictate his life.  I honestly don't even know if this constitutes as alcoholism because he says it doesn't and that it's considered \u201dhealthy to have a drink a day.\u201d My husband has at minimum one alcoholic beverage everyday, but it's usually a lot more than that.  It's been this way for many years and I've mentioned many times my concerns with it because I come from a family of alcoholics.  It's turned into a situation where he can't even go anywhere without having some form of alcohol minus working.  He even drinks a beer before my pregnancy appointments. \n\nThe catch is, he is not a mean drunk, he doesn't even really *act* drunk, doesn't slur, seems mostly normal...  His drinking doesn't \"impair\" him much, the only thing is, he has an absolutely horrendous memory.  He can't remember sooo many things & throughout the years it's turned from a cute, quirky trait about him into something that really impacts our marriage.  It's obviously become worse as time goes on and it really has started to mess with every day life things outside of our marriage. The memory issue has gotten so bad that even our kids are noticing it and he always blames it on \"well I've always had a bad memory\" despite me telling him it's gotten so, so much worse.\n\nI've watched him take shot after shot after shot of tequila and literally not even seem phased except for on very rare occasion... Like tonight.  I've been noticing over the past month or two the drinking has picked up and he's gone through two 12 packs in a week and didn't have any tonight so he drank one full glass of red wine, then one full glass of white wine, played with the kids, ate a big dinner and is now violently sick to the point he's holding back throwing up passed out on our bed.  It's starting to trigger me.... And I know when I address it tomorrow he's going to blame it solely on the big dinner.\n\nHe's told me numerous times this isn't alcohol addiction, it isn't a problem, he can stop when he wants to then jokes that he just doesn't want to, and that drinking daily in moderation is healthy.  He genuinely believes his drinking is within moderation, but can go through a gallon of liquor in a week. I've brought up our kids, the impact or influence it could have on them, I've brought up how this could affect his health down the line, I've told him it triggers me because of my family's past, and I've explained to him genuinely I just don't think it's ok.  He always says he doesn't drink much and what he does drink is not excessive even though I see with my own two eyes otherwise.  I don't know if I'm just triggered because of my family history though so I've let it slide again and again.\n\nIs this alcoholism? Because if so, what the hell do I even do to fix this when I've tried in the past to no avail and he doesn't see an issue at all? It isn't affecting MUCH as far as him acting drunk all the time because like I said, he handles his alcohol well, but I can see this is potentially a big problem and I love him enough to seek external advice because I'm at a loss.",

        "selftext": "This is part 3 of my recovery journal.\n\nFor the first part, click [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClotSurvivors/comments/1j8e4ua/recovery_journal_multi_clots_inc_2_dvt_2_weeks/)\n\nFor the second part, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClotSurvivors/comments/1jdjxn9/recovery_journal_multi_clots_inc_2_dvt_2nd_week/).\n\nDay 15: Kept a chill day.  Slept in, but I woke up and did some house work.  Was up on a small step ladder for about 30 minutes cleaning out a kitchen cabinet, then moved on to dishes and laundry.  I treated myself to a full beer today!  I had been avoiding alcohol due to my condition and trying to loose weight, but felt that I had worked enough to indulge a little.  Did a weigh in today, and was down 12.5 pounds since my diagnosis.  This was after a night of stomach aches and bathroom trips so some of that is likely water weight.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND LOOSING WEIGHT THAT FAST.\n\n18+ only: >!Wife and I had some uh... intimate time together finaly.  Today was the first time since my intial onset of symptoms over a month ago.  We were not able to do any of our normal positions, however we did manage to utilize alternative methods of intimacy. I won't lie - I was very frustrated that I wasn't able to perform, but my wife was more than understanding and assured me that given the situation, she was very happy to have what we had.!<\n\nDay 16: Started the day with some basic around the house chores (about 2 hours on my feet).  Had to run some errands in the city (about 30 minutes away).  The car ride scared me - even though I knew it was only 30 minutes it felt like a lifetime of not being able to move around.  I don't have claustrophobia, but I felt that I was a touch claustrophobic during the experience since I wasn't able to actually get up and move around. Once we got to the city I did finally sit down and have a diet cheat meal - a cheeseburger and fries.  First one in a month! Holy smokes was that the best damn cheeseburger I have ever had. I decided that once I am down about 25 pounds over my starting weight (I'm about 1/2 way there) I will move into one cheat meal a week.\n\nWalked around a few stores today looking at a new computer for the wife, plus took a look around a sporting goods store.  After the sporting goods store my knee was giving me trouble, so we started to head home.  We made a pit stop on the way home to look at a few new cars (gonna be in the market soon - hopefully!) so I spent about an hour up moving around on my feet looking at various cars.  Ironically while my knee was hurting just a few minutes before, it was mostly better after walking the car lot. After we got home and rested for a bit, I was able to go out and walk a little over a mile.\n\nDay 17: feeling the pain in the back of the knee a little more today in the morning.  Went for some small walks (about 1/4 each time) and noticed the pain really kicking up in the back of the knee.  Very frustrated at that. Asked my wife near the end of the day if we could go out and get some knee braces for myself. On the way back from the store I broke down crying in the car.  I have been so incredibly frustrated about not being able to walk simply because of my knee issues.  That seems to be the one thing holding me up in recovery.  The mental games that we play on our selves when we are injured can be extreme.\n\nDay 18: Saw the Dr again for a follow up.  Got a refill for Eliquis and got put on medication to help with high blood pressure. (Blood pressure has hovered around 145-150/85-90 for some time now). Thankfully my recent blood test results don't show any noticeable damage to my circulatory system yet (mainly worried about high blood pressure damage). One interesting thing to note - before I was diagnosed with my clot BP between my left and right arms was about 15 point difference on average, with the right side always higher.  That seemed a bit odd. After being on Eliquis for a few weeks now and feeling mostly better from the clots, the BP is consistently under 10 points difference between arms.  I don't know if that's coincidence or perhaps something that can be used as an early warning sign.  I will ask my Dr about it.\n\nIn regards to my knee issues, the Dr states that she thinks the clicking and pain in my knee are coming from my clot behind my knee (believing the clot is rubbing against something). Said she could send me to physical therapy, but its not outside the realm of reason to just 'wait and see' what happens to it first. I am noticing that standing for extended periods of time leads to pain the next day. I will be trying to avoid extended standing for a few days to see if that helps with the recovery of my knee. Started wearing a knee brace to help with the pain and discomfort from walking/hobbling.\n\nDay 19: Stayed off the knee for most of the day and wore a soft compression support brace on my knee all day.  Felt good about the clicking in the back of my knee where the clot was.  In the evening I went for a walk - and within a few steps my knee was clicking again in pain despite using the compression brace.  I was right next to a light pole and broke down in front of my wife, and nearly punched the pole out of frustration (thankfully I didn't - that likely would have sent me to he hospital to deal with internal bleeding).  Defeat washed over me again. I took a few moments and steadied myself.  The sad thought of never walking again was ever present in my mind. It took some effort, but I got those pushed aside and tried to diagnose the issue from a mechanical perspective. What exactly was wrong, and why?\n\nI knew the blood clot was in the back of my knee, and I knew it was still tender and inflamed there. I also know I had been limping for the last month and a half at this point because of the pain.  I needed to determine if the issue with my knee was because of limping, because of inflammation, or because of the clot.  I focused on my walk - trying to find my old stride.  It took a few minutes, but finally found it.  From the best I could tell - I had spent so much time off of my leg that essentially I forgot my stride.  My leg didn't remember how to move the way it used to.  I was able to do about 1 mile before my muscles got tired and I had to go in.  But by focusing on my normal stride I was able to get decent results. \n\nDay 20:  I decided to keep off the knee for the majority of the day, just to give it some time to reduce inflammation.  It seems like inflammation in addition to forgetting my stride was causing my issues with walking. \n\n  \nDay 21: Walked around for a small amount during the afternoon.  Totaled about 1.5 miles in one sitting.  Knee was doing OK when I focused on my normal stride.  It felt awkward at first as I found my body trying to default to a limp to protect the leg, but then I would deal with the 'snapping' issue of my knee.  When I forced myself to use my normal walk I found that I was doing alright.  I could tell my muscles hadn't been worked properly in a full month as walking quickly tired out my leg.  That was a bit frustrating, but it was an acceptable tradeoff.  I figured I would have to bring my leg up to strength over time.  \n\n  \nWill update later with week 4!",

        "selftext": "So for many years I've been fighting clubbing it to various anonymous meetings when I was lonely or bored.  I have arguably struggled with alcoholism, but also never fit in to AA.  I would have stories about having a single beer just to break a sobriety streak, and making myself puke so I wouldn't get drunk while hanging out at the bar that no one could understand.  Anyway, as years gone by Ive found a wholesome circle of weirdos who get each other as one often does in life.  A couple times the topic of starting our own group has come up and it was dismissed.  Until recently.  An old highschool friend of mine were chatting who had begun fighting clubbing it to meetings as well.  We started having \"playdates\" as adults.  We'd make collages one night, cook the weirdest pies we could come up with another night.  Sometimes just talk.  We found it was most fun with three or more people.  Then we started to actually flesh out this crazy idea, circling around the realization that third places are dying and that's one of the big draws of going to support groups.  We actually bought a website, and started a discord.  It has 12 steps, and 12 traditions, but we are firm one no leaders, no formal heirarchy.  Just another XYZ Anonymous cult, but without the XYZ really.  We are calling it Lonely, Awkward and Bored.  Because that's really what everyone is at all those support meetings anyway, sans the beautifully diverse spectrum of medical and mental health struggles.  I guess what I'm asking here is.... Does anyone want to help us make this a positive happy thing for the world? We have some ideas, not many set in stone.  Our solemn pact is that this shall be for everyone, and it shall do no harm (safe, positive, etc.)",

As of February I turned 28 and noticed my drinking patterns have increased a lot. I find myself every weekend, including Sundays going to the bars and also drinking alone most week days in my bedroom. I feel ashamed of myself because I never wanted to repeat the same patterns my sister has gone through, but I\u2019m genuinely trying to look for some advice on ways to become sober slowly. I\u2019ve googled how to become sober but would really appreciate some advice from folks here that are sober and their journey and where and how to begin with it.

Did it resonate with you in any meaningful way? Did it feel familiar, or maybe help you make sense of your own experience?\n\nAlso curious\u2014are there other books or movies you used to see one way and then completely flipped on?

What did the head waiter say?\n\n*\"and said to him, \u201cEveryone serves good wine first, and then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one; but you have kept the good wine until now.\u201d* \n\nWhat does \"drinking freely mean?\" Im not saying this therefore means everyones getting blasted, but I dont think this would allude to the guests being scrupulous about their wedding consumption of wine. We can enjoy the gift of alcohol, God knows it makes us feel good and is treat for us. Were there other reasons why Jesus did his miracle? Of course.\n\nIf we really had to walk a tight line with its consumption, then I think he'd just call it a sin and wed be like the Muslims. Drunkenness is a spectrum and is different for each person, feeling the effects of alcohol isnt 'drunkenness'. Theres no point in drinking alcohol if not to feel its effects. \n\nMoral of the story is, its scrupulous inducing to make people have to worry about the sinfulness in drinking. Is there a line that can be crossed where drunkenness is a problem? Yes obviously, when it causes you to sin and becomes a gluttonous indulgence and starts to harm those around you. But to drink to the point of feeling it is the point of drinking, no sense in pretending its not.",

        "title": "We have a 9mo. I talked to my wife about her attraction to me. Help me decipher this.",
        "selftext": "We haven\u2019t been doing the best for well, 9 months now. Prior to having a baby, we were doing decent. Not an all time high, but we were fine. Since having a baby, we have had a lot more disagreements, and just an overall lack of connection. I\u2019m assuming that comes with the territory of having an infant. I recently made a comment on how I feel bad about how I look and how she makes me feel like she no longer finds me attractive. Her comments were very unclear, and despite me asking her to clarify, I still feel very lost with her messaging. Can someone help me decipher it?\n\nRegarding physical attraction. Prior to having a baby, I was in the gym 5 days a week. I was in pretty decent shape. Now, I gave up working out a long time ago. I just have an average physique now. I fully intend on getting back in the gym, but I\u2019m not expecting that to happen for another 1-2 years, if not more. With that, I was also healthier back then. Everything about me seemed healthier - my hair, my skin, my stamina, my vitality, everything. I felt more confident. The part that bothers me the most is that I used to never run cold, my body was always warm and felt strong, now, I constantly run cold. It just gives me this overall sensation of feeling unhealthy. I don\u2019t really eat too bad currently, I don\u2019t go crazy with junk food, I don\u2019t drink alcohol or use drugs, I don\u2019t even drink coffee. \n\nHer comment regarding my physical attraction was that she doesn\u2019t expect me to be in the shape that I was in before, but she says \u201cyou don\u2019t take care of what you have now.\u201d I don\u2019t know what she means. She made a comment about my hair - I have been growing my hair out the past two years, and up until that point, I always had short hair. She says it just doesn\u2019t look healthy. She made a comment about wanting me to shave my mustache, but that doesn\u2019t make sense because I\u2019ve had a mustache the past decade straight, all throughout the time I knew her. I have a strong mustache with an okay beard, I don\u2019t want to get rid of my mustache. I look goofy as hell clean shaven. I don\u2019t know what to do with that. I can get my haircut any time, the only commitment I have to it is that I\u2019ve been growing it for a couple years now. Mustache, I dunno. Physique, it would be unfair to expect me to look any different at this stage, but I can add some home workouts in the meantime I suppose.\n\nThen her other comment was regarding how I treat her. Prior to the baby, we had our together activities and then our own separate hobbies, so we were always able to take care of our own interests to be \u201cfresh\u201d for one another. Obviously, we don\u2019t have time for that now, so things are super tense most of the time. We support each other the best we can so we can try to take a break here and there, but it only goes so far. She mentioned that she doesn\u2019t feel like I take care of her needs anymore, and wouldn\u2019t elaborate. I have no idea what that means. I have an incredibly close relationship with our baby, and I have no problem taking care of the baby all on my own. Which I don\u2019t several times during the week, most often so my wife can work but sometimes so she can take a break. I help clean, I help with food, I do all the bottles, I help address the night wakings, I help bathe the baby, I help put the baby in bed, I do it all. She had a hand surgery almost two months ago where she couldn\u2019t lift the baby for over two weeks, I took care of most things for that entire time. I\u2019m a very hands on dad. I thought me having such a strong connection with my baby would be attractive.\n\nShe summed it up by saying it\u2019s because of how I feel about myself, which affects how I treat her. I just don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t complain about how I feel about myself to her at all, in fact this may be the only time I ever said anything. The only time I complain about myself is when I just feel cold all the time, which is a new thing for me. Even then I say it playfully.\n\nCan someone help me understand what she means here? I\u2019m going to follow up with her another day, but I feel more lost than I did before I brought it up. ",

This includes soap, tea tree oil, aspirin paste, hydrogen peroxide, bactine, (rubbing) alcohol i.a.      Advice should be in line with current professional aftercare guidelines or be backed by scientific medical studies related to the healing of puncture wounds in relation to piercings.*          \n*Falsehoods and misinformation that go beyond lack of nuance are likewise not allowed.*\n\n**Some more example of stuff you shouldn\u2019t advice people to put on their piercing**\n\nLemon juice, garlic, nail polish remover, mustard, vinegar, apple cider, ginger, urine, saliva. \n\nWe\u2019re not joking, (although we wish we were), these are real life examples of what people  adviced to put on a piercing to help the healing on this subreddit \n\n**But it worked for me**\n\nHealing in spite of and healing because of are two very different things. Our bodies can handle a lot of the crap we put it through. There is no evidence to be found that the examples of \"home remedies\" mentioned in the rule, work better then good aftercare and good quality, well fitted, jewelry. There is however evidence of risk with these \"home remedies\".         \nAs this is a piercing subreddit we of course are big fans of bodily autonomy. What you do with your body and piercings is your choice, but that doesn't mean it's something you should advice a random internet stranger to do. If you want to offer advice, the advice should not come with serious risk of harm.\n\n**But this dude/girl recommended it on tiktok/youtube**\n\nWhat are their credentials? Are they a body piercer? Are they a good body piercer? Do they have a solid online portfolio of well executed piercings? Are they being sponsored? There certainly is amazing and great information to be found on sites like TikTok and Youtube, but do use your critical thinking skills and don't blindly assume that whoever is posting it must know what they are talking about.   \nQuick tip, if they claim it worked after \u201djust\u201c two weeks, it\u2018s really nothing that good care and good jewelry wouldn\u2019t fix in the same amount of time just without the risk of serious harm.\n\n**But my piercer advised it to me**\n\nNot all piercers are great. We hate to say it, but a lot of piercers are not great at all. So unfortunately, just because your piercer advised it doesn't mean it's good advice. If your piercer has ever recommended one or more of the examples mentioned in the rules to you, our advice would be to find a better piercer.\n\n**Falsehoods and misinformation**\n\nThe internet isn\u2019t know for its subtlety and nuance is often lost. This subreddit is no exception to the regret of a lot of awesome piercers. We do however draw the line at falsehoods and misinformation that may cause harm if someone took it at face value.",

        "title": "The Cost of Entertainment and Board Game Value",
        "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI've been diving deeper into the hobby since November and my god am I having fun! But something I've noticed, both in my own circle of friends and family, and in online discussions, is the way a lot of people perceive the \"cost\" of games. \n\nHave you seen comments on here questioning someone's large board game collection when they excitedly share, especially when they are new to the hobby? The sentiment often revolves around the idea that if a game isn't played dozens of times, it's somehow a frivolous or wasteful purchase. But I think we should break it down and add more value to the experience of playing a game.\n\nMy most played game is Pandemic, which I picked up for around \u20ac30. I've played it about 15 times now, which works out to a cost of just \u20ac2 per play. For a solid hour of engaging entertainment, and a shared experience, doesn't \u20ac2 feel incredibly reasonable?\n\nConsider when we pop into a pub and happily spend \u20ac6-7 on a single beer, often multiple times in one sitting. A smoker who spends \u20ac15 per day on a pack. Or a dinner out for two which could easily cost more than \u20ac50. We rarely bat an eye at these expenditures, yet the idea of a \u20ac25 board game being \"wasted\" if only played a handful of times seems to linger in some corners of our minds.\n\nFor me, the comparison is clear. If I have the choice between potentially spending \u20ac25 on a few drinks at a bar or investing that same amount in a board game to enjoy with friends, the board game wins every time. Even if it only hits the table once or twice, the couple of hours of fun and connection it provides feels entirely worth that \u20ac25. \n\nThis cost for something that can be played again. Think about other hobbies; Golf, Bowling, Billiards Cinema, etc. where you pay every time. When you frame it this way, I think a diverse board game collection doesn't seem so extravagant, does it? It's an investment in experiences, in quality time with friends or family, not to mention the mental stimulation.\n\nThis year, my wife and I have made it a weekly routine: every Sunday evening, we dedicate around three hours to play a new board game, usually doing a best 2/3. I've been buying a new game every week and we take turns each week learning and teaching to one another. Even if a game cost me \u20ac50, that joy and engagement we get from those dedicated three hours each week make it an incredibly valuable purchase. It's without a doubt a far more enriching and connecting experience for us than a fleeting two-hour dinner that could easily cost double that amount. If it's a bad game, that's fine, I could have spent that \u20ac50 to go see a bad movie at the cinema, it's all an experience.\n\nFor me personally, this shift in perspective is influenced by a decison to give up alcohol back in October 2024 and realising I had all this extra money from not drinking. The money I used to spend at the bar on Fridays or Saturdays now often goes towards expanding my board game collection. And honestly, it feels great. I'm trading fleeting moments for lasting memories and tangible sources of joy. Isn't that a positive thing?\n\nI think it's a good idea to consider the \"cost\" of things, especially when it comes to experiences and hobbies that bring us genuine happiness and connection. A board game isn't just a cardboard box and some tokens to 'waste' money on; it's a gateway to stories, challenges, shared moments and an experience. The value isn't solely determined by the number of plays, but by the quality of those plays and the joy they bring.\n\nI hope next time when people are considering adding a new game to their collection, or when they hear someone question the size of their hoard, that they remember the cost of a night out, a fleeting indulgence, or even just an hour of passive entertainment. Save it and buy a game that will give you at least one night of solid fun and put it on your shelf to remember it. ",

I got the best possible outcome and I encourage you to do exactly what I did if our situations are at all similar.\n\nI got my DUI 11/2023 in San Diego, CA. I blew .104 at the scene and .087 and .084 at the station. I was very cooperative with the officers throughout. I have no priors or criminal history at all. I\u2019m 26M. I did all the FSTs and felt like I did well, according to the arrest report I technically passed them all, but admitting to drinking when asked was enough probable cause to ask to breathalyze me. Oh well. I refused a blood test. \n\nMy case, oddly, did not get filed until 10/2024. In the meantime I hired a lawyer with a great reputation and paid $6000. I self admitted to rehab 01/2024, unrelated to the DUI as I had a bad drug/alcohol problem that was ruining my life anyway. I completed rehab and then completed an IOP 2/24-5/24. I started going to AA/NA religiously 11/24-onward (wasn\u2019t going before bc I relapsed for a bit). \n\nI got every AA and NA meeting signed off on. I got a letter from rehab stating how much I participated in the program and took my recovery seriously. I got the same from IOP. I got a letter from my psychiatrist and my therapist. I got a letter from my boss about my changed character and from my dad. My lawyer encouraged me to do MAAD impact panel before they asked. \n\nThe outcome/plea deal I took was a charge for wet reckless, NO PROBATION, NO CLASSES(!!), $1100 fine. That\u2019s it. Everything is done. Feel free to ask me questions. The judge was very impressed with all the treatment I did. I can get the wet reckless expunged from my record in 06/2025.",

        "selftext": "Heya everyone,\n\nSaw that there's a few posts going around for people to join in some new/ongoing games, so I thought I'd keep the train going.\n\nCurrently looking for 2-3 more players for a Cyberpunk Red campaign, based on the module \"Hope Reborn.\" LGBTQ+/GSRM friendly table, with a non-binary (they/them) GM. It's a story all about being people acting as mercenaries who get hired to help out a local bar against anything the world'll throw at ya: from drug addicted streetrats, to neo-nazis, killer clowns from outer streets, and the worst threat of all: Lobla-I mean... corporations.\n\nIf you're interested then feel free to shoot me a message, I am aiming to have **session 0 on April 4th**. Happy to add people on discord if that's preferred. It'll be run out of an office building downtown, and sessions will run around 3 hours from 5:30pm-8:30pm on Fridays, and as this is not made by WotC or Paizo the campaign will not take more than (probably) a few months to complete. New players are more than welcome (module is designed to be for newer GMs and beginner-level players). Below is information relevant to the module from a document I made for the campaign:\n\n**Setting**\n\nThe game takes place in Mike Pondsmith\u2019s alternate history \u201cCyberpunk\u201d world. Details can be found online, but to go over some major points: Japanese tech companies created cybernetic replacements/enhancements for body parts and organs. The US disintegrated after a coup by the big 4 military/security departments and is now split between the free states and the central government, all separated by the Louisiana River. In 2023, after 3 long years, the 4th corporate war, waged between Arasaka and Militech, ended when a bomb was detonated in the center of the city you now call home: Night City, Northern California.\n\nRebuilding in a post-war world, where the official numbers undercut millions of undocumented refugees, corporate spec-ops teams, the homeless who outnumber the cops 10-1 and you average joe just trying to keep it safe outside of the climate-disaster we call our planet earth. People try day by day to survive. However, some decide, instead of sleeping on the street or striking it out attempting to live off wage slavery, to become edgerunners; mercenaries who take odd jobs in order to make enough money to pay rent, and maybe buy an upgrade to maybe survive till the next morning\u2026\n\nYou ain\u2019t some corpo-backed assassin. You ain\u2019t the most powerful fixer, nor a Rocker who\u2019ll make waves in our AI algorithm powered manufactured feeds. You\u2019re just some schmuck who managed to find some buddies, or maybe even enemies, to huddle up with to blast onto the city streets to make a quick euro.\n\n**The Plot**\n\nStarting off, you\u2019ll work an odd job for a fixer who asks you to meet inside of \u201cThe Forlorn Hope,\u201d a place that acts as your home away from home; or perhaps just a place to get into a bar brawl and get fuckin\u2019 wasted. After some time, the owners of the bar start asking for favors after hearing of your exploits. What follows is one escapade after another, helping to keep a night city institution with some actual-fucking-culture around in the face of rogue clowns, neo-nazi punks, and good \u2018ol corporate capitalism.\n\nYour characters made at session 0 will have some level of connections that may show up over the course of events in the story. Maybe that old netrunner you pissed off is your key to the next objective. Perhaps there\u2019s an old friend from your days in that outback biker gang-turned-nomad clan who\u2019s willing to give you a hand in tracking down your next target. Whatever the case, you\u2019ve got rent to pay, bullets to unload, and a life to improve before you flatline for good\u2026\n\n**Game Info**\n\n*Role Recommendations:* Roles that would work well: Rocker, Solo, Tech, Medtech, Nomad, Netrunner, Media  \n*Roles that may have a hard time:* Lawman, Exec, Fixer\n\nCharacter Creation Guidelines:\n\n1. Try to avoid power-gaming. This module is meant for newer players and average power level characters.\n2. Think about how your character plays outside of combat. Alot of missions in the module either benefit from non-combat skills, or might even require a use of combat as the last-possible-resort\n3. Your characters will be played in an urban setting, so taming wild animals and hunting for survival might not get you too far.\n4. Your character must have a minimum of 12 in 1 combat-related skill.\n5. Silencers are banned due to game-balance reasons.\n6. All weapons are to be purchased from the \u201cToggle\u2019s Temple\u201d DLC because the guns\u2019ll have some flavour that way\n7. Your backstory must tie into the world in the following ways:\n\n* Why are you in Night City?\n* What\u2019s a goal your character has? Get a certain piece of tech? Revenge for a job-gone-wrong? Save your ex lover-turned-joytoy from a Tyger-Claw nail salon?\n* How/why did you join up with your crew?\n\nDowntime is a core mechanic, which for the most-part will be dealt with out-of-session via discord servers. You can use this time to source weapons/gear, heal up from injuries/visit a doctor, make a few quick euros, or other things that can be talked about with the GM.\n\n**Social Contract:**\n\nDuring session 0, everyone is expected to create characters whose personalities are able to work together. As well, while there is room for a lot of self-expression within the module, it is expected that players will do their best to follow the beats and stay relatively close to the module\u2019s plot and intentions (IE not abandoning missions or killing your fixers who own the bar).\n\n**Content Moderation**\n\nThis game is set in a dark-future of our own world. Thus, some darker elements will pop up in the game. Their prevalence, however, can be talked about with the GM.\n\nContent that can be modified/excluded: Body horror, torture, homophobia, sexism, transphobia, mentions of police brutality, terrorism.\n\nContent core to the story/module: Gang violence, neo-nazis, blood, gore, mental health trauma, drug use/abuse, dire-poverty & dystopia, clowns.\n\n*The content described in this document is of the GM\u2019s recollection. If there is something not covered in this document, please reach out to the GM to confidently talk about safety tools, boundaries, and other concerns.*",

For the past 3 years I've had a great tenant. She has a kid that's going to a local school, never heard any issues from her, so forth. Out of the blue this evening I got a letter from the property manager that there's apparently a male occupant who moved in, and has been causing a ruckus. Like... things breaking in the suite, police being called, reports of drug use, you name it. I have to start by sending a letter to kick him out, but I'm not 100% sure on the verbage, as I don't even know the guy's name. If he doesn't go, the board will push for getting the mom & her kid evicted, which... while I don't want it to come to that, might end up happening? I've been searching around online, found section 36 of the RTA of Alberta. I guess I'm looking for any other resources people can suggest.\n\nLike... do I just have the letter state \"All adults not on the rental agreement have 14 days after receipt of this letter to vacate the premises\"? Lost a bit, please help?",

I finally quit smoking weed at 26 after 8 years of addiction. Thanks mostly to alcohol taking its place, which is way worse imo.  \n  \nI\u2019m a binge drinker so I would drink myself into a stupor a few nights a week. Sometimes days in a row. It was there to comfort me during some lonely dark times. I would often go a week or 2 sober, twice I even made it to 3 weeks, only to reward myself with a night of binging which would launch me right back into the cycle.  \n  \nWhat initially pushed me these 3 months is that studies show that most alcoholics who go sober do so before age of 30, and I\u2019m 29 turning 30 in a month.  \n  \nNow what motivates me is the fact that for the past 11 years, since I first started smoking weed, I have been trying to get to where I am right now. I know that if I give in to a temptation, which comes almost every night, that I would feel incredibly shameful the next morning. I know it\u2019s only been 3 months but I finally feel in control. My reasons not to drink are stronger than the temptations.  \n  \nI have to thank this subreddit for being here.

However I finished my drink after I ate, and I was unsure when that was.\n\nAnyway I decided to forgo the Eucharist in the hopes of providing a good example to my children and students.  But it made me wonder if drinks were included in the hour fast, and if the type of drink mattered?",

        "selftext": "We had been together for 7 years, had our share of breakups, both cheated but always found our way back and forgave. We grew up together and both had messed up home situations, so we had a level of understanding. We were terrible at communicating our needs, and a lot of miscommunications we let fester and probably turned into resentment (I assume on both sides). Also left some things unsaid related to life goals and instead of talking them through we\u2019d just stay surface level at times because work took so much out of us.\n\nHe was a heavy alcoholic, and I tried to help him recover but I had no idea what I was doing. People at AA told me I did everything the book says not to do but I was so afraid for his life, I would have tried anything to get him to stop. I told his parents and I\u2019m sure that broke trust, but I didn\u2019t know where else to turn.\n\nThis year I thought we were turning things around. We both made some great goals and started making big steps towards them, reconnecting and getting better at communicating. He got a new job and seemed to be doing well. I was on the verge of also getting a new job too (my old job was a big source of my unhappiness) and he was taking steps towards sobriety on his own. \n\nJanuary he became very distant and instead of communicating right away I chose to play games and distance as well. Long story short he started dating someone else and I found out the hard way. This person supposedly helped him kickstart sobriety and get better at his job.\n\nI wrote a letter conveying my true feelings and left the door open saying I\u2019d always be there for him, a week later he sent me a long message about what went wrong between us, how the new relationship happened, how he feels, how he feels so bad for hurting me and how he thinks were incompatible. He apologized for his alcoholism hindering me and told me he wishes he was a better boyfriend, I almost cried.\n\nI typed a nice reply taking accountability for my shortcomings in our relationship and setting some of the misconceptions straight. Specifically said how he never hindered my life and I just didn\u2019t always know how to show my love. I told him what I\u2019ve been doing to improve and how I wished I was better to him too, but haven\u2019t been able to send it. Not sure if I\u2019m blocked or not but I haven\u2019t tried to reach out since.\n\nHe\u2019s more avoidant attachment I think, and I think I\u2019m more anxious attachment, \n\nOn one hand I want to cut ties completely and try to move on, I\u2019ve already been making big changes to myself, emotional independence, and my career. I\u2019ve also made some new friends, getting out of my comfort zone, and feel like I\u2019m on a good life path. \n\nOn the other hand, even after 2 months I truly believe he\u2019s the love of my life and soulmate. I miss him dearly and he really was my best friend. I want to try to sit down and fix things, but also want to respect his recovery and if this person is truly helping him to handle his addiction I don\u2019t want to interfere. Im so torn on what to do. I feel like we\u2019re so disconnected but I don\u2019t want to hurt him\n\nDo I try to reach out again or leave him alone?",

        "selftext": "Just started my experimental mead with 20 herbs and spices today! I'm an Asturian-American, I love orujo de hierbas, a type of high abv liquor made with grape pomace and flavored with herbs and spices. But I've been unable to find orujo de hierbas in the US and I also love to make mead so I decided to go for an orujo de hierbas mead. The closest thing I've found in the US to orujo de hierbas is Strega, an Italian digestif and I decided to include some elements of that. I am looking for a strongly herbal and spiced, after-dinner, high abv, digestif-like mead. If it doesn't work, who cares, it it does, yay!\n\nMy favorite orujo de hierbas uses 32 herbs and spices, Strega uses 70. Like American alcohols, neither have ingredient lists but around the internet, I was able to find some mentions of the key herbs and spices, especially since orujo de hierbas is sometimes homemade by infusing orujo blanco with herbs. I came up with a list of 20 herbs and spices and honestly, just kind of threw them in as I saw fit, but I also was smelling and drinking the last bottle of orujo de hierbas I have as I went along to try and decide on the amount of each herb and spice.\n\nMost orujo de hierbas have an abv of around 30%, Strega abv is 40%. Neither of those are happening with my homemade mead so I aim for 20% by stepfeeding with EC-1118. I am feeding with DAP and Fermaid O. I left extra headroom expecting the herbs to take up more room, but also I will be adding more honey in stepfeeding.\n\nMy herbs and spices are basil, black tea, cardamom, chamomile, cinnamon stick, cloves, fennel, gentian root, hierbabuena (spearmint), juniper berry, lemon verbena, licorice root, mint, nutmeg, orris root, rosemary, saffron, sage, star anise, and thyme.\n\nI hope it works out, but if it doesn't it's a fun experiment!",

        "selftext": "My experience seemed almost out of a movie, which is why a year later, I still find myself constantly thinking about it. We were both at a work conference, never having met before. When we were introduced, something between our eye contact said that we would be ending up together that night. We stared at each other a beat longer than normal. The rest of the day was playful but harmless flirting. I found out he was married with kids, he found out I was engaged. As the night progressed and alcohol became involved, I knew it was a done deal. It\u2019s rare that I meet someone who has the same mannerisms and sense of humor as me, and he matched it perfectly. Next thing I knew, we shared an insane and long night together. Nothing I ever experienced before.\n\nA month later, we both agreed we couldn\u2019t get it out of our heads, and I booked a flight to visit him. (For context, I have a reason to travel for work and he doesn\u2019t, which is why I make the trips.) It was irrational and risky but it was so worth it. A few months after that, I flew there again. The trips are exciting and well spent, but nothing will ever compare to that first night of pure rush and desire. Almost a year later now after the conference, I have another flight booked to see him soon. The interesting thing about the entire affair is that it really isn\u2019t emotional; we don\u2019t communicate unless it is to book a trip or to talk about what we want to do to each other\u2026I know I don\u2019t have feelings for him but I am infatuated with the sex and the attention.\n\nI\u2019ve never had an affair before this and he claims he hasn\u2019t either. I have no desire to be with him in a real setting but I find myself constantly replaying that night over and over in my head.  I think the reason I want this to continue is because we both have something to risk so there is no fear of blowing up each others\u2019 lives. We said immediately that we have no intention of leaving our SO\u2019s for this. So it feels safe and sexy and I wish there was almost a guaranty that it would continue. He\u2019ll go dark for several days, sometimes even weeks, at a time. I\u2019m trying to remind myself his life looks a lot different than mine, but when you\u2019re fantasizing daily about someone, those dark days can reallyyyyy stretch on.

Guards for ships?\n3. The equatorial jungle areas. I don't feel as though fruit and herbs are enough. \n-wine/other alcohols from certain fruits? Wood and/sap? Maybe ships from the wood?\n4. Underdark. Several trade cities around the largest paths to the underdark\n-fungi for sure. Maybe cheeses and other fermented goods? Or because of volcanics and caves, gunpowder and weaponry that makes use of it?\n\nIf anyone has some ideas on expanding the list of goods, commodities, or services I would appreciate it. Or adding more to ones I already have a solid idea or 2 for. Each country can be fairly self sustaining if need be but trade=wealth and all that jazz so I'm wanting to fill this out.\n\nThe 1st campaign in this world will be related to pirating and having an idea of what goods will be obtained from stealing from the trade companies of specific countries could be important. Or if the party ends up wanting to works as a trade company. Idk what they will want to do yet, kinda a sandbox style campaign. I already have a handful of potential plot hooks to dangle for them and finishing off with the trade amongst countries will let me tie them in. ",

        "title": "How to best communicate with my boyfriend over small issues?",
        "selftext": "I need some advice on how to best communicate with my (28F) boyfriend (28M). We have been dating for 5 years now and lately it seems like I am becoming more irritated by him but I don't know how to communicate this to him.\n\nFor example, last week was my birthday and offered to take me to a restaurant that we had been to once before and liked, although I ended up getting sick after eating there which I just chalked up to the food not agreeing with me. We decide to go anyway because it's a unique restaurant and I do like their food. We have a good time but right after we get in the car to leave and I remark how much I enjoyed the dinner, my boyfriend explains how disgusted his was with his meal and how he feels sick to his stomach and wants to throw up. Then I myself start to feel sick the more he talks about it. Basically he just kept saying how he needed to throw up. But he wasn't actually serious. When I kept asking him every 15 minutes he said he felt fine. So it's my birthday and I'm feeling nauseous for the rest of the night imagining him throwing up when it's just him getting too much in his head over something that isn't even true. \n\nThen, he offers to take me to a bar. We never really drink or go out so for us it's just a fun thing for my birthday. At the bar he doesn't drink at all, and keeps insisting on me not drinking too much. After my first drink, he asks me if I'm sure if I want a second. Then when I comment how it's odd that he offered to take me to a bar but doesn't want me to drink, he turns around and says I should drink more. I end up having 3 drinks total at which point I am ready to go home, but he then insists I should have another drink. Like all this is said in earnest, he's not being sarcastic. It makes no sense and it just annoying honestly. \n\nAlso at the bar, he started doing this thing he always does where he will bite the inside of his mouth excessively and just kind of stare and when I try to talk to him, he will hardly engage and just do quick responses and like stare back at me. This makes me nervous and uncomfortable, especially in public because when it's just us at home I can ignore it to an extent. It literally makes my chest pound and I feel like I can't take a breath, basically I get anxious from him being anxious. I told him what I was experiencing and he said he was sorry but that he couldn't do anything about it although he wishes he wasnt as anxious. \n\nHe then made the wild comment that \"maybe *I* (as in himself) should have the drinking problem\", meaning he thinks he should start drinking a lot to not be as anxious. But he was making a reference to my brother who was recently in rehab for alcoholism. I told him I found that comment rude because it's not a choice for people to be alcoholic, and it's a serious disease and not something to joke about. He just replied that it wasn't a joke and he was serious that he thinks he should drink more for his anxiety. Like in total earnestness. But like how would someone not know how rude that comment was? It really upset me.\n\nJust tonight, he drove me to the shop to pick up my car from inspection, and on the drive home I heard a noise from the car so I mentioned it to him when we got to my house. He immediately tired to diagnose the problem and wanted us to stand in the freezing cold trying to diagnose the issue which to me makes no sense since neither of us are going to fix it anyway - I'm just going to take it back to the shop since they caused the issue. They were closed when I picked up the car so I planned on calling them in the morning. So I say I'm going inside and he follows me in and proceeds to tell me I should call the shop. And I'm just like, \"Obviously I am going to call the shop.. what else would I do, not call the shop?\" Pretty sarcasticly because what kind of question is that? At which point he just says he is leaving and he leaves. Like he was really offended by me being annoyed by him telling me to do the obvious. \n\nSo I'm just sitting here questioning reality.  I feel I am either really impatient, or he is just too easily offended and anxious. But this is a cycle that repeats; he gets more worked up over time over random things in our relationship then will do something dramatic like abruptly leave, and then tomorrow he will be super nice to me again. So I am at a loss for how to communicate with him through this small issues. I feel that maybe he wants so badly to be a good boyfriend that I see right through it and have a hard time appreciating it because I just want him to be real and not be so nervous all the time. I really have no idea though and would appreciate some input.\n\nTldr: My (28F) boyfriend (28M) seem to be having communication issues over the smallest things which ends up affecting the overall relationship.

        "selftext": "Why Liver Problems Delay Toxin Removal: Understanding Your Body's Crucial Detox Process\n\nThe human liver is a remarkable organ that acts as the body's primary filtration system, working tirelessly to remove harmful toxins and maintain overall health. However, when liver function becomes compromised, the entire detoxification process can grind to a halt, leaving your body vulnerable to dangerous accumulations of harmful substances. Most people don't realize how critical liver health is to removing toxins efficiently, and the consequences of a struggling liver can be far-reaching and potentially life-threatening. Understanding why liver problems delay toxin removal is essential for maintaining optimal health and preventing serious medical complications.\n\nClick here to learn more for a healthier liver: https://livpure.myofferdeals.com\n\nThe Liver's Critical Role in Detoxification\n\nThe liver serves as the body's primary detoxification center, processing and eliminating harmful substances through complex metabolic processes. When functioning normally, this vital organ:\n\n\u2022 Filters blood from the digestive tract\n\u2022 Breaks down toxins and medications\n\u2022 Produces essential proteins for blood plasma\n\u2022 Regulates blood sugar levels\n\u2022 Converts toxic ammonia to urea for safe elimination\n\nHow Liver Damage Impairs Toxin Removal\n\nLiver problems can significantly compromise the body's ability to remove toxins effectively. As liver cells become damaged, their detoxification capabilities diminish, leading to a dangerous buildup of harmful substances in the body.\n\nClick here to learn more for a healthier liver: https://livpure.myofferdeals.com\n\nTypes of Liver Damage That Affect Toxin Removal\n\n1. Fatty Liver Disease\nExcessive fat accumulation in liver cells can reduce the organ's functionality. This condition prevents the liver from efficiently processing and removing toxins, leading to:\n\n\u2022 Reduced enzyme production\n\u2022 Decreased metabolic efficiency\n\u2022 Increased inflammation\n\u2022 Impaired toxin breakdown\n\n2. Hepatitis and Liver Inflammation\nViral and autoimmune hepatitis can cause significant liver damage, dramatically slowing toxin removal.

        "selftext": "Hello,  I (18 F) suddenly lost little cousins (13 M) to a car accident while he was riding his bike and the funeral is this weekend. The problem is with my Grandmother (60 F) needing someone to bring her to the funeral. My grandmother is someone who has been distanced from most of the family due to alcohol abuse but has also lost her license recently. My Uncle (Cousins' Father) is incarcerated at the moment (not stating for privacy) and can not get out to attend his son's funeral but has asked for someone to bring his mom (grandmother) because she is wanting to go and so he can have his side of the family there. My mom (38 F) has made it clear she will not be bringing her being she cut her off awhile ago for alcohol use and personal boundaries and has now asked me to be the one to bring her. I have been the peace keeper in the family for awhile and while I typically would there's other issues with this specific situation. The funeral is already bit over 3 hours from where I live (over 6 hours round trip) and if I were to go get her it would add another 30 to 45 minutes to the drive which wouldn't be a problem typically but I work both the day before and the day after the funeral. The day before i work till 7pm and the day after I go in at 8am . My partner who will be accompanying me (mostly for driving reasons cause of personal/medical issues) also works the day before getting home about 11:50pm to 12:15am. The funeral starts at 10am lasting till 12pm then there's a pause with the final ride starting at 2pm followed by a block party probably ending around 6pm to 7pm so already an early leave time and late return time. I also drive a 2  door 2014 honda civic so my car is already cramped when it comes to space. I considered the idea of having her come the night before so I wouldn't have to leave so early to pick her up but I do not trust her not to bring alcohol into my house and vehicle. I understand my family wanting her there but with the business I'm not sure if I want to risk my peace of mind. So would I Be The A Hole if I told my family no to bringing my grandmother. Also Uber is not an option where we are located ",

        "selftext": "Bueno, como ya adelanto en el t\u00edtulo este art\u00edculo trata sobre una persona que lleva como un a\u00f1o siendo una parte bastante importante de mi d\u00eda a d\u00eda e incluso de mi vida por as\u00ed decirlo. La historia viene de mucho atr\u00e1s y para poder entender todo creo que tengo que explicar ciertos temas. Soy un chico de 22 a\u00f1os, gay. Cuando ten\u00eda 12-13 a\u00f1os conoc\u00ed a este chico del cual os hablo el tiene 12 a\u00f1os m\u00e1s que yo. En el momento en el que lo conoc\u00ed estaba pasando por un momento personal complicado que arrastr\u00e9 durante un tiempo el cual me hac\u00eda esconderme de mi verdadero yo (ser gay) y tomar conductas que de alguna manera cre\u00eda que me aportaban virilidad y de alguna manera quitaban del foco la idea social que la gente pudiera tener sobre  m\u00ed de que yo era gay (vivo en un \u201cpueblo\u201d de 12.000 personas) esas conductas fueron empezar a tomar drogas muy joven tanto marihuana como sped, la marihuana con 13 y el spid a eso de los 15. Consumos que mantengo a d\u00eda de hoy, salir en exceso de fiesta, discusiones excesivas en casa debidas a como yo me estaba cohibiendo. En fin una adolescencia movida. Pues bien mientras todo eso transcurr\u00eda yo segu\u00eda teniendo mis necesidades y la verdad que ten\u00eda un par de cojones porque media al mil\u00edmetro ciertos aspectos de m\u00ed como la forma de hablar , o reducir al completo mi \u201cpluma\u201d pero no dejaba de tener relaciones con hombres cuando me excitaba, bueno pues el m\u00e1s usual era este chico. Estuvimos como 3 a\u00f1os quedando cada vez que nos daba el calent\u00f3n a ambos. Llegaba le saludaba \u00edbamos al l\u00edo me vest\u00eda y me ve\u00eda. La verdad nunca me atrajo realmente pero era casi lo \u00fanico accesible que ten\u00eda debido a mi edad y al sitio en el que vivo. Aparte que as\u00ed me ahorraba ligar con otro y que quien sea se pudiera enterar . Bueno pues a los 17 a\u00f1os conoc\u00ed al que a d\u00eda de hoy es mi ex pareja, dos a\u00f1os menor que yo. Sal\u00ed del armario y de repente casi ni me importo de lo tanto que me enamor\u00e9 de \u00e9l, fue el primer chico que deverdad me gustaba guapo inteligente de mi edad carism\u00e1tico, como yo vaya. Algo q cre\u00eda q nunca iba a aparecer. Estuvimos cuatro a\u00f1os juntos , \u00e9l es un narcisista maligno o grandioso llamarlo como quer\u00e1is, al igual que su madre . Pero en esto no voy a indagar mucho porque da para otro art\u00edculo. El caso es que obviamente el a\u00f1o pasado decid\u00ed terminar con la relaci\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n porque no me qued\u00f3 de otra. Mi expareja estando juntos poco a poco se fue alejando de m\u00ed, pero seg\u00fan \u00e9l para m\u00ed segu\u00eda estando, primero se alej\u00f3 emocionalmente y luego pas\u00f3 f\u00edsicamente , los \u00faltimos tres meses dorm\u00ed con \u00e9l 5 noches y podr\u00edamos haber dormido todas las que hubi\u00e9ramos querido. Pero \u00e9l segu\u00eda dici\u00e9ndome todos los d\u00edas lo mismo que me dec\u00eda el primer d\u00eda , y segu\u00eda jur\u00e1ndome la misma fidelidad y constancia en nuestra relaci\u00f3n, bueno claramente un d\u00eda cansado de humillarme le dej\u00e9 de hablar y empeze el proceso m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de mi vida , dos meses antes mis padres recien separados porque mi madre descubri\u00f3 que mi padre (camionero) llevaba una segunda vida a sus espaldas (durante 20 a\u00f1os) en resumidas cuentas ten\u00eda una amante en cada sitio que descargaba, pero cuando ven\u00eda a casa era el padre ejemplar, a ojos de todo el mundo. Nadie en el pueblo hablar\u00eda mal de \u00e9l todo lo contrario , guapo simp\u00e1tico muy amable muchos don de gentes y sobretodo una capacidad por parecer el bueno de la pel\u00edcula inaudita, el caso es que yo nunca llegu\u00e9 a ver a mi madre feliz y creo que era el \u00fanico (tengo un hermano mayor) que fue capaz durante un tiempo antes a darse cuenta de lo que estaba pasando y de c\u00f3mo era mi padre. De echo cuando todo esto pas\u00f3 al \u00fanico al que no sorprendi\u00f3 en absoluto fue a mi. Bueno, todo empez\u00f3 con mi madre un d\u00eda pidi\u00e9ndome que le revisara el tel\u00e9fono a mi padre porque ella no se atrev\u00eda y \u00e9l dorm\u00eda siempre pegado a \u00e9l, me las apa\u00f1e para inventarme que no me quedaba bater\u00eda en el m\u00f3vil y que me lo dejara para ducharme y as\u00ed poder escuchar m\u00fasica , vi todo lo que ten\u00eda que ver sal\u00ed del ba\u00f1o y se lo cont\u00e9 a mi madre . En el momento estaba dispuesto a hacerlo para que mi madre no siguiera en la mentira q estaba puesto a q repito q yo ya era bastante consciente de lo que hab\u00eda. Bueno empieza el proceso de divorcio me quedo a vivir en casa con mi madre y mi hermano y mi padre se va . Pasa un mes y mi madre fuerza una discusi\u00f3n en la cual termina ech\u00e1ndome de casa reconozco que se me fue de madre pero tambi\u00e9n tengo claro que lo puso todo en bandeja para que as\u00ed fuera, iba detr\u00e1s suyo caminando se par\u00f3 en seco sin querer le empuje y dijo que le hab\u00eda empujado queriendo. Siendo consciente d los problemas de conducta que hab\u00eda tenido en la \u00e9poca \u201cadolescente\u201d y los cuales llevaba varios a\u00f1os sin sacar en casa y menos hacia ella . Empez\u00f3 el peor momento de mi vida con 21 a\u00f1os empeze a consumir speed a diario (antes solo era fines de semana ocasionales) y a consumir mucho alcohol todos los d\u00edas. No sal\u00eda de casa me empez\u00f3 a dar mucha ansiedad la gente, me cortaba exageradamente cada vez que ve\u00eda a alguien conocido , pasaba alg\u00fan amigo o buen conocido y empezaba a sudar en exceso me picaban todas las extremidades me faltaba el aire todo en su gran medida por culpa de lo que llevaba en el cuerpo tambi\u00e9n en el momento y el miedo obsesivo que me generaba el que la gente que me conoc\u00eda me viera en el estado que estaba. Bueno pues volv\u00ed a hablar con este chico, un chico que nunca me demostr\u00f3 que me hiciera bien al rev\u00e9s, con 14 a\u00f1os le ped\u00ed que respetara mi decisi\u00f3n de no contar nada y se encarg\u00f3 de fardar que estaba conmigo con sus grupos de amigos que conoc\u00edan todos a m\u00ed y a mi hermano, se creaba perfiles en Instagram para hablarme cuando le dej\u00e9 de hablar por contar mi condici\u00f3n, cuando empeze con mi expareja cre\u00f3 una cuenta ( mi expareja era muy guapo) de Instagram falsa como si fuera un joven guapete para aparentemente de primeras tirarle la ca\u00f1a a mi novio, esto se volvi\u00f3 algo continuo y lleg\u00f3 un punto que me colm\u00f3 la paciencia y decid\u00ed hablarle a esa cuenta, empez\u00f3 a llamarme cornudo , feo , gordo . Este chico siempre me ha dicho que soy el chico m\u00e1s guapo que h visto en su vida y seg\u00fan \u00e9l me idolatra casi, bueno sigui\u00f3 insultando. Al tiempo recurr\u00ed a un amigo inform\u00e1tico y verificamos que fue el. Paso un tiempo hasta que retomamos la historia en el divorcio de mis padres , cuando entr\u00e9 en el punto  que no quer\u00eda salir de casa porque literalmente me daba verg\u00fcenza , yo llegue a pensar que empezaba a tener paranoias o problemas mentales serios . El sab\u00eda que yo necesitaba alcohol tabaco papel de liar gramos etc etc a lo largo de una semana. Y os aseguro que cuando se est\u00e1 en ese punto a lo largo de un d\u00eda puedes llegar a tener varios ataques de ansiedad por que te falte algo de eso, \u00e9l me lo tra\u00eda todo. Al principio el primer mes que quiso volverme a ganar Nose cu\u00e1ntisimas cervezas fue capaz de pagar. Paquetes de tabaco que me tra\u00eda a casa sin pedirlo y podr\u00eda seguir . Ah\u00ed ya estaba en lo m\u00e1s profundo de mi pozo, cuando empeze sin quererlo sin darme cuenta y lo mejor de todo sin que \u00e9l me atrajera NADA ni f\u00edsica ni personalmente a depender de \u00e9l . A enfadarme por qu\u00e9 no me contestara. A reaccionar como si fuera mi pareja y de alguna manera incluso repel\u00eda mi forma de enfadarme con \u00e9l porque no quer\u00eda darle ese placer pero lo volvi\u00f3 algo imposible. Al tiempo se fue haciendo m\u00e1s selectivo a la hora de traer tabaco alcohol etc ya no era cuando yo quer\u00eda sino cuando \u00e9l, empez\u00f3 a tener comentarios pasivo-agresivos desmoraliz\u00e1ndome much\u00edsimo , aprovecho la figura del salvador para entrar de nuevo, me otorg\u00f3 todo para que siguiera destruy\u00e9ndome se qued\u00f3 observ\u00e1ndome fijamente y cuando estaba listo para actuar actu\u00f3. Como? Comentarios delante de gente que sab\u00eda que por como yo estaba socialmente me supon\u00edan mucho, del calibre de esta noche tampoco has dormido no? Has llevado a tu perra al veterinario o ni eso te ha dejado hacer el cuerpo? Todo esto delante de ciertas personas de mi importancia. Cuando sab\u00eda que la cita era al d\u00eda siguiente, hab\u00edamos hablado de eso hace media hora, y cuando el d\u00eda de antes el que me estuvo animando exhaustivamente a comernos un gramo y bebernos unas cuantas cervezas y dem\u00e1s fue el, con la diferencia de que \u00e9l en ese momento no ten\u00eda un problema de consumo a diario ni una depresi\u00f3n . El caso es que le tuve que dejar las llaves de mi casa para que me sacara a la Perra un d\u00edas porque no estuve en casa pues bien, hoy me quedaba un solo papel de liar (nunca llevo el recuento pero este librillo me ha durado mucho menos de lo habitual) Y justo hoy a las 12 de la noche cuando voy a hacerme mi porro de buenas noches con el \u00faltimo papel (pensar\u00eda que ya no me quedaba) me escribe y me dice voy a pasar por la m\u00e1quina expendedora ahora que saco al perro necesitas algo? Cre\u00e9is que puede llegar a extremos m\u00e1s serios conforme siga viendo que me sigo alejando de \u00e9l ? Lo de hoy del papel aunque sea algo insignificante me ha dejado muy preocupado y creo que dice mucho, todo esto sumado a que ya van unas cuantas veces q quedo alguna noche espor\u00e1dica con alg\u00fan amigo, no le he contestado y me lo he encontrado en mi calle con el perro, imaginar el rato que deb\u00eda de llevar todas las veces para encontr\u00e1rmelo al llegar a casa a hora dispares. Y bueno aclarar que igual este texto me beneficia mucho m\u00e1s ya solo por la parte de soltar lo que he llevado dentro durante un a\u00f1o y a\u00fan no hab\u00eda soltado que por las respuestas que pueda recibir, creo que se percibe lo agusto que me acabo de quedar . A\u00fan as\u00ed estoy muy interesado en otros puntos de vista ya que no he hablado esto con nadie . Por eso he intentado detallarlo lo mejor posible, gracias de antemano.",

        "selftext": "Hello,  I (18 F) suddenly lost little cousins (13 M) to a car accident while he was riding his bike and the funeral is this weekend. The problem is with my Grandmother (60 F) needing someone to bring her to the funeral. My grandmother is someone who has been distanced from most of the family due to alcohol abuse but has also lost her license recently. My Uncle (Cousins' Father) is incarcerated at the moment (not stating for privacy) and can not get out to attend his son's funeral but has asked for someone to bring his mom (grandmother) because she is wanting to go and so he can have his side of the family there. My mom (38 F) has made it clear she will not be bringing her being she cut her off awhile ago for alcohol use and personal boundaries and has now asked me to be the one to bring her. I have been the peace keeper in the family for awhile and while I typically would there's other issues with this specific situation. The funeral is already bit over 3 hours from where I live (over 6 hours round trip) and if I were to go get her it would add another 30 to 45 minutes to the drive which wouldn't be a problem typically but I work both the day before and the day after the funeral. The day before i work till 7pm and the day after I go in at 8am . My partner who will be accompanying me (mostly for driving reasons cause of personal/medical issues) also works the day before getting home about 11:50pm to 12:15am. The funeral starts at 10am lasting till 12pm then there's a pause with the final ride starting at 2pm followed by a block party probably ending around 6pm to 7pm so already an early leave time and late return time. I also drive a 2  door 2014 honda civic so my car is already cramped when it comes to space. I considered the idea of having her come the night before so I wouldn't have to leave so early to pick her up but I do not trust her not to bring alcohol into my house and vehicle. I understand my family wanting her there but with the business I'm not sure if I want to risk my peace of mind. So would I Be The A Hole if I told my family no to bringing my grandmother. Also Uber is not an option where we are located ",

        "selftext": "We had been together for 7 years, had our share of breakups, both cheated but always found our way back and forgave. We grew up together and both had messed up home situations, so we had a level of understanding. We were terrible at communicating our needs, and a lot of miscommunications we let fester and probably turned into resentment (I assume on both sides). Also left some things unsaid related to life goals and instead of talking them through we\u2019d just stay surface level at times because work took so much out of us.\n\nHe was a heavy alcoholic, and I tried to help him recover but I had no idea what I was doing. People at AA told me I did everything the book says not to do but I was so afraid for his life, I would have tried anything to get him to stop. I told his parents and I\u2019m sure that broke trust, but I didn\u2019t know where else to turn.\n\nThis year I thought we were turning things around. We both made some great goals and started making big steps towards them, reconnecting and getting better at communicating. He got a new job and seemed to be doing well. I was on the verge of also getting a new job too (my old job was a big source of my unhappiness) and he was taking steps towards sobriety on his own. \n\nJanuary he became very distant and instead of communicating right away I chose to play games and distance as well. Long story short he started dating someone else and I found out the hard way. This person supposedly helped him kickstart sobriety and get better at his job.\n\nI wrote a letter conveying my true feelings and left the door open saying I\u2019d always be there for him, a week later he sent me a long message about what went wrong between us, how the new relationship happened, how he feels, how he feels so bad for hurting me and how he thinks were incompatible. He apologized for his alcoholism hindering me and told me he wishes he was a better boyfriend, I almost cried.\n\nI typed a nice reply taking accountability for my shortcomings in our relationship and setting some of the misconceptions straight. Specifically said how he never hindered my life and I just didn\u2019t always know how to show my love. I told him what I\u2019ve been doing to improve and how I wished I was better to him too, but haven\u2019t been able to send it. Not sure if I\u2019m blocked or not but I haven\u2019t tried to reach out since.\n\nHe\u2019s more avoidant attachment I think, and I think I\u2019m more anxious attachment, \n\nOn one hand I want to cut ties completely and try to move on, I\u2019ve already been making big changes to myself, emotional independence, and my career. I\u2019ve also made some new friends, getting out of my comfort zone, and feel like I\u2019m on a good life path. \n\nOn the other hand, even after 2 months I truly believe he\u2019s the love of my life and soulmate. I miss him dearly and he really was my best friend. I want to try to sit down and fix things, but also want to respect his recovery and if this person is truly helping him to handle his addiction I don\u2019t want to interfere. Im so torn on what to do. I feel like we\u2019re so disconnected but I don\u2019t want to hurt him",

        "title": "I Hate my Life, is There a Reason to Keep Going?",
        "selftext": "*I have debated on how to write this for a long time now and I figured I should just do it. So I apologize if it's kind of long or just a stream-of-thought kind of mess (I will do my best to organize it though).*\n\nI honestly don't know what to do anymore. I turned 40 the end of last year and I am struggling to keep going. I am depressed and suicidal, though I have been since I was a teenager. ***I am in no immediate danger of suicide***; I couldn't ever do that to my mom, she is the only reason I am still here. Doesn't change the fact that I cry myself to sleep every night thinking of it though.\n\nA little back-story. I grew up with a fairly normal family in a small rural town, and have 3 siblings; 1 sister, and 2 brothers. We were all homeschooled growing up because my mom was not a fan of the public school system and had her masters in education so she taught us. Even though we were homeschooled, we weren't socially isolated. We did sports (soccer, karate, football, paintball, etc.), as well as attending groups with other kids. My parents got divorced when I was about 12 and all my siblings and I stayed with my mom and she continued to homeschool us while working full time. I always had an *extremely* difficult time making friends, which I attributed to being homeschooled. But some of my siblings did just fine making friends when they were kids and into adulthood. My sister had many friends growing up, then struggled with self-esteem but is now engaged. My 2 brothers are doing well also, one is married with 5 kids, the other is in a relationship and is a complete extrovert but also extremely popular (the kind of person everyone likes and is everyone's friend). \n\nUnfortunately however I have been pretty much alone my entire life. I had 2 friends who lived on our street when I was about 8, they were brothers, but that friendship only lasted about a year (don't remember what ended it). I didn't make any other friends until I was 19. I had been going to a youth group at my church to try and make friends for over 2 months with not so much as someone's phone number. Finally one night after another unsuccessful youth group after everyone was gone I went to talk to the youth pastor, I couldn't stop crying and I was trying to ask him how do I make friends? His response was just talk to people and making friends is easy (if only). The next Sunday before church I had 2 of the guys there ask if I wanted to play some basketball and we ended up becoming friends; I honestly think the youth pastor talked to them, as they had never talked to me in the previous 2 months. That friendship also only lasted around a year before they moved away. After that I came to terms with the fact that I was gay (I had known I was attracted to guys since I was 13-14, but didn't really accept it). The only other \"relationship\" I had was a \"romantic relationship\" in my mid 20's, I thought I had found someone, but it turns out he didn't give a shit about me, they just wanted to use me for my money. They Iwere horribly abusive and were constantly using drugs/alcohol. The only kiss I've ever had is a peck on the lips from him (never did a deep kiss or make out, he said people only do that on tv or in junior high. As soon as I started school and stopped working I had little/no money, so he said he's moving in with someone he met on Grindr.\n\nIt's not like growing up I didn't have contact with people. Sure I wasn't in public school, but we did a lot of after school stuff. I got a job at 16, worked at Walmart for 4 years. After that I went to college, I went to 3 different colleges and ended up with 4 different degrees (couldn't decide on what I wanted to do). Went to work straight out of college and have been working full-time since. And in all of that, with all the social contact I still never made any friends. The whole time I had assumed my social problems had come from being homeschooled, however it wasn't until my early 30's when I learned I had Asperger's/autism. Had my GP doctor send me to see a specialist and after a few visits and a lot of tests I was diagnosed with autism. \n\nI always knew my life was kind of pointless and meaningless, but there was always the hope I would get better socially, and my problems would get better as I got older. Especially after the diagnosis, I hoped that would help me understand my problems better and be able to connect with people. But here I am at 40 years old and nothing has changed. I still have no friends, no relationship, no kids. The only person I have in my life right now is my mom. She is living with me and has been since I was 30, I am taking care of her since she has had multiple hip and knee replacements, and has bad mobility problems. But I'm starting to realize that there is really no point to me living other than my mom, she would be the only person that would really care. My Grandparents and my dad have all passed away, and I don't see my siblings all that often since they live a good distance away.\n\nIt all really sucks, I hate the way my life is... I want a family and kids so bad. I'm a Christian, so I'm not supposed to be gay and marry another guy. But I'm also not attracted to women (*I wish I was),* it would make it easier to have a family. Although even if I was, I am still autistic and fucked up. If I can't even make a friend, the chances of a romantic relationship are practically non-existent. And I know I could adopt, but I am not going to screw up a kid that badly (single autistic parent with no social skills).\n\nI'm sorry for this long mess. I have just been sitting on this for a long time and have nobody else to tell it to. I just need to get it out and vent whether someone reads it or not.",

The funeral starts at 10am lasting till 12pm then there's a pause with the final ride starting at 2pm followed by a block party probably ending around 6pm to 7pm so already an early leave time and late return time. I also drive a 2  door 2014 honda civic so my car is already cramped when it comes to space. I considered the idea of having her come the night before so I wouldn't have to leave so early to pick her up but I do not trust her not to bring alcohol into my house and vehicle. I understand my family wanting her there but with the business I'm not sure if I want to risk my peace of mind. So would I Be The A Hole if I told my family no to bringing my grandmother. Also Uber is not an option where we are located ",

We understand that this is not curative, but she is hoping to do HIPEC to give her more time as she has two children. It is so hard getting in with these specialists and the waiting time is long.

She is verbally abusive and sends thousands of long berating messages. But for what happened yesterday I got out of the shower and heard her screaming at my brother (15) and he walks out saying she punched him. So I had asked what was going on and asked if he needed to call our dad. Long story short she accused me of inner fearing with her parenting but I can\u2019t help myself when she sits there and tells him how worthless he is. She doesn\u2019t come home after work and drives around drinking. I am the one who picks him up from school if he needs to, I make him dinner, i make sure he\u2019s up for school etc. but I had said maybe he needs to go live with dad then she slapped me in the face. My brother called the cops but I didn\u2019t press charges because it\u2019s my mom and I love her and I am an empath to a really big fault. And she says she will self exit often. Today she still is blaming me and saying how her mom hit her growing up and is just trying to validate it. I\u2019m not saying she isn\u2019t a good mom, she is always is buying us stuff trying to take care of our medical needs etc. when she is sober. I guess I am just venting. Yes I know I should move out, money isn\u2019t great, I\u2019m scared to leave my brother but my dad is trying to get custody, I have 2 cats and there is no where to take them and I don\u2019t want her to resent me for leaving. Sorry if this doesn\u2019t make sense I am just upset. ",

They don't drug test or do background checks, which means you will work with some shady people. As a former employee I have smelled weed in the bathrooms, known of employees and management drinking on the job and hiding alcohol in their office mini fridges. Senior management plays favoritism like no other. Senior management is bipolar and will be buddies with you one day and then someone else comes along and you're moved to the side. You can't say anything personal to anyone in management because they sure will go and tell everyone including other employees all of your business. Most of the project managers and branch managers are entitled and will treat office staff as if they are beneath them. Senior management also likes to employ their children to come work and they are treated as if they are better than everyone and that they cannot do wrong. So do not bump heads with them, not even once because they not only get to scream at you in front of everyone but management will take their side and fire you on the spot.

Knowing him, he called in maybe once or twice, but has stopped entirely after that, and yes, this has gotten my dad fired from multiple jobs in the past. According to him he's done everything under the sun to get clean like meetings, sober living houses, medications, etc.\n\nNow, here's where I ask for advice on what to do next. Obviously, I don't want to live like this and take care of him anymore despite him getting sick during the withdraw period. It sounds cruel but I'm just tired of it. \n\nSomethings to keep in mind before commenting, 1; I don't know how to drive. Driving has always been both scary and not exciting for me. It doesn't help that I've been in  3 accidents from ages 5-10. Despite that, I do have my learners permit, but I did fail my driving test. \n2; I've always had this odd \"fear\" or \"anxiety\" over anything that has to do with being an adult. I know its important to be a proper member of society, but its been difficult for me for some reason. \n\nTLDR: I'm just looking for a remote job so I can make some money and get the hell out of here. I have some experience in customer service which I know some remote jobs are looking for. Phone anxiety is a bit of an issue when it comes to strangers, but I can fight through it. Please, anyone, let me if you have any ideas or suggestions.",

        "selftext": "Ever since I was little Ive bee  addicted to constantly living online. I've ruined so many of my relationships, discarded so many life altering opportunities, and socially ostracized myself completely from every community I've ever been in, all in the name of upholding my social media addiction. This sounds ridiculous. it's not heroin and it's not alcohol so it's not that serious, but it has genuinely ruined my life so much so that I'm happy for the brief moments my electricity goes out because I'm finally freed from these devices.\n\nI can't stop compulsively checking my phone and laptop. All I've been doing for the past nine years is ignoring my school work completely, sabotaging all of my friendships and totally cooping myself up in my room so that I can finally just be alone with my video games. I used to be such a dedicated artist back when I was little, and I still have slight talent for it, but I've given up all of my hobbies just because I can't pry myself off of social media.\n\nThis is all that my life has become. I live on the fucking line, I don't have any real social life out of this. Everyday I wake up, scroll through tiktok, chat with my friends online, play some games and sleep. My eating schedule is destroyed and I won't even talk about my sleeping habits because those are infinitely worse. I have no friends. I have zero social skills, I am extremely awkward and embarrassingly unhygienic. I rarely go to school and God forbid I ever do any type of homework because that's not happening.\n\nI bought a guitar last year and I really swore I was gonna dedicate myself to it. It's been in it's case for months now, untouched because I have other things to do -- like wasting time online for example. I don't have anything but my social media presence and I feel like I'd go crazy without it because if I ever was shut out of my virtual spaces I'd have nothing to look forward to in the real life.\n\nI've abandoned all of my hobbies. All I do is just watch youtube videos, at the very bare minimum write fictional works of my own and fluctuate between different friends online that barely mean anything to me. I've been doing this every single day for nine years straight. I am an educational failure and I'm considering dropping out. I'm never going to sustain a job due to a plethora of issues and the fact that I don't want to be separated from my devices.\n\nMy daily online screentime has been religiously above 11 hours for so long now that it's become expected. At minimum it's nine hours, at maximum it's been 16 hours or maybe even more. I've lost count because I just keep distracting myself with worthless things. I will never become anything special, I'm hopelessly addicted with no way out and I can't quit because I'd lose everything. I hate the outside world. I don't ever leave my house and I don't interact with anyone aside from my immediate family\n\nI'm a disappointment, practically a NEET and a worthless member to society. I will never efficiently contribute. I'm beyond saving.",

        "selftext": "Just came across this sub & wanted to share my story in hopes that there is someone out there with a similar experience that was able to find some level of relief & would be able to share. I am getting toward the point of not knowing where else to turn to find answers.\n\nBackground: I (30 M) am going on just about a decade of undiagnosed GI issues, following \\~7 years straight of Doxycycline (from ages 14-21) for acne (I was young and dumb and didn't know better. The dermatologist said to keep taking it, so I kept taking it). Around my Junior year of college I started to feel frequently nauseous, which my primary care doctor attributed to the long standing Doxy use and had me stop. The nausea seemed to temporarily resolve, until several months later I started to feel like I was having histamine reactions (red chest w/ hives) when eating foods I was accustom to eating, as well as with any alcohol consumption. This lead up to one particular day where I felt especially off (almost as if my whole body was numb), and after trying to \"sleep it off\", woke up in the middle of the night with an absolutely horrible sharp pain on the left side of my abdomen.\n\nThis was really the start of the long standing symptoms I have until this day. I am now nauseous almost all of the time. I am constantly tired & feel like I am never rested despite getting plenty of sleep. I can, 100% of the time, feel a dull pain on the left side of my abdomen from where I woke up that night with a sharp pain. Certain foods & drinks (particularly spicey foods & alcohol) can really exacerbate the severity of these symptoms. Typically the severity of my symptoms fluctuate, where I can go periods of times (several months) at least being able to tolerate a reasonable diet, always followed by symptoms getting worse again. I have noticed in particular that stress & alcohol consumption can really make things worse.\n\nWhile I don't drink often, one thing that is extremely odd is when I am at least feeling decent, I can have a drink or two and be okay. When my symptoms get worse, the first thing I will notice is that a single drink will make me completely drunk - whereas a few weeks prior it would have had very little effect. When this happens, it usually followed by nausea & vomiting that can last days. I am not able to eat solid foods for a few weeks after this.\n\nI have seen countless doctors (GI, Rheumatologists, Naturopaths, Immunology etc.) & spent 10's of thousands of dollars trying to find a solution, or even just someone who can tell me what's wrong with me. I have not felt myself in a decade. I am almost always in a constant state of \"agitation\" - as strange as it sounds, it literally feels like that spot in my stomach is emanating poison into my body. It feels like there is icy hot in my intestines. It also feels like food is not passing through my digestive track properly. My symptoms are almost always worse after eating literally anything.\n\nI have had several endoscopies & colonoscopies, CAT scans, MRI's, ultrasounds, breath tests for SIBO (which the doctor said were \"borderline positive\".) My GI doctor (who I will say, genuinely wants to help) recently prescribed Cyproheptadine, hoping that a medication that can assist w/ motility would improve things. I have not seen any improvement.\n\nThere is more that I can share, but I hope this at least provides a basis of what's going on. Any insight that anyone can provide or any similar experiences that someone has had & can share would literally be more than I have been able to get in 10 years.",

While I\u2019m still feeling great mentally\u2014no depression, increased drive, and even a heightened libido\u2014I\u2019ve been experiencing *severe* sleep issues over the past three months.  \n\nI\u2019m unintentionally pulling all-nighters multiple times a week.

I\u2019ve been napping during the day to compensate, but I know this isn\u2019t sustainable.  \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Did adjusting your dose or timing help? Any advice on managing this without losing the positive effects of the medication? Should I try getting on a sedative rather than risking changing my meds?\n\n**PS:** I\u2019ve also heard I shouldn\u2019t drink alcohol while on Bupropion. Why is that? Are there any other substances I should be avoiding while taking this?",

        "selftext": "Firstly we both have a partner for a very long time. Story starts here, me and him been working quite closely together for some time. He is my senior and is guiding me in most of the projects. Months ago I started admiring him as he was really smart, emotionally stable and definitely someone I can rely on (work wise). I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve always been drawn to people who are strong and capable. \n\nEvery workday, he\u2019d be the one to initiate conversations, and our relationship grew closer day by day.\n\nThen came the Christmas lunch party at the end of last year. We both drank quite a bit. I wasn\u2019t feeling well that day, and on top of alcohol I felt exhausted and went to a corner to rest with my eyes closed. He tugged gently at my sleeve and asked softly if I was okay. I said I was fine. Later, when everyone was moving to the next venue, he grabbed his jacket and mine too. I found it really warm.  \n\nOn the way, we laughed and joked around, and I even had my arm around his shoulders the whole time. When we reached a crowded club, he asked if I needed to use the restroom, and I said yes. Since all my colleagues know I have really bad sense of direction, he said,\"Follow me,\" and kept looking back every few seconds to make sure I was still behind him. Before going into the restroom, he repeatedly reminded me to wait for him right where I was.  \n\nAfter a few more drinks, I went to the bathroom again. When I came back, I saw him kept looking around. I knew he was searching for me because I do the same when he\u2019s gone. Later, he went to buy somemore drinks. I said I didn\u2019t want any, but he still got me one. I took a few sips but couldn\u2019t finish it, so I asked if any other colleagues wanted it. He snatched it back and said he\u2019d drink it. The atmosphere felt a little weird and ambiguous, I guess?  \n\nAt some point, though, I\u2019m not sure if I misread things, but maybe he realized things were getting inappropriate (since we\u2019re both in relationships). He suddenly disappeared and later made up some bad excuse about leaving early. I think he was trying to pull back before things went too far.  \n\nRecently I realised everytime we looked at each other, we can't stop laughing. I don't know what happened though but I feel like it is abnormal.\n\nSome days in a month, we need to travel together to other offices for meeting. He used to just keep quiet in the car or just talk about work related stuff. But recently, he started sharing about his personal life, schedule and even family to me. There was once he made a sudden brake, he unconsciously used his hand to prevent me getting thrown out of the car, not very obvious but he definitely did it. \n\nWe shared a straw for drinks. I'm not sure is this normal? \n\nWe chatted a lot on teams, sometimes work related, sometimes non work related or just rant about other colleagues, just feel like there isn't any secret between us. I have a strong feeling he likes talking and chatting to me. Sometimes we do still chat after work and sometimes he just started random topics with me.\n\nHe always gives me compliment on works I've done. Giving me credits in front of others. \n\nI feel a bit confused now, I'm not sure is he feeling the same as me or he just being nice. I'm not expecting him or me to break up for each other, I'm not doing this at least but I just want an answer. ",

        "selftext": "My dad, 60, has a brain tumor that, long story short, has left his right leg basically paralyzed and his right arm with less strength.\n\nAbout six months ago my husband installed a device in his truck so he could still drive without relying on his foot. He had been living with my mom, his ex wife, for the previous three years while he had cancer treatment and healed from heart failure. My mom is also difficult largely because of her borderline personality disorder and alcoholism, but she *did* take care of him. I'll always give her that. \n\nThen in early March he fell and broke his hip. Surgery went well and the ensuing hospital stay was a disaster. He made me (only daughter, 30) his medical POA and then the social worker talked us into me being his general POA as well. My dad started getting mean, he was diagnosed a long time ago as bipolar. He stopped letting my mom see him and he refuses to go back to her place, honestly he shouldn't as he'd just verbally abuse her and she's not able to handle his level of care anymore anyway. They have a long mutually abusive relationship and I readily admit I'm glad they're away from each other.\n\nNow he's in a wheelchair, he wasn't three weeks ago, he used a cane occasionally previously and he's delusional and thinks he can do all of this himself (meaning calling me to do everything three times a day and pulling me away from work). \n\nMonday he checked himself out of the acute therapy ward he was in without telling me. Luckily the nurse did, I went down there, I had already packed his few belongings in his truck and somehow found a disabled accessable room last minute and booked him for a month. He got kicked out of there today for being a jerk, flipping people off and harassing the employees at the dealership next to this hotel. He claims he was being chill, I know him better than that and I completely believe the very nice woman who manages the place. He booked a different room until Monday and my husband and I took off work AGAIN to get him in there. \n\nI was at the hospital every day twice a day minimum to try to keep him from being awful to staff. I've been either doing errands or driving him around for two days now, and I had to shower and bathe him yesterday which I did not sign up for. I had him call around for caregivers so hopefully he actually did that. I had put in so much work with the hospital to find him an assisted living facility, he turned that down. He keeps talking about how he's so much smarter than everyone and blah blah blah, fine dad, figure it out. \n\nThe guilt has been eating me alive but I just can't do this anymore. He's ruined relationships his entire life and I'm over it. He won't listen to anyone and he refuses proper help. It's so sad, and so maddening. I can't let him ruin my life or marriage. \n\nI feel out of options and I'm so angry he didn't take advantage of what he was offered, so many people fight for the help he was offered and it is such a shame he seems to have zero perspective on what he passed up. He has no idea how bad his situation really is and he'll never take responsibility for it.\n\nAny advice? Similar experiences?\n\nThere's so much more context but I've already written a novel. I'm just afraid that he's going to end up back in jail again (he's been a frequent flyer).",

        "title": "Parents were abusive, SA'd from 3 years old, 4 bfs died, son died, current bf is hiding other women, harassment at work and now out of a job. What's the point anymore?",
        "selftext": "Throw away acct for privacy.\n \n\nMy mother was physically and verbally abusive and let men into our home who would take advantage of me. I remember things from 3 years old that I would rather not discuss. This went on until I left at 16. She used to beat my brother and I so bad we couldn't walk and she would sometimes make us stay home from school so she wouldn't be found out. My dad wasn't around, mostly, but when he was forced to see me, he told me he hated me being around him and his new family because I'd corrupt them.\n\n\n As I said, I left home at 16, and I moved in with my boyfriend and his mother and her boyfriend. His mother and her boyfriend were crackheads and regularly brought trouble to the house. One time she owed money to a drug dealer and a group of huge men with guns came to the house, took her to \"work off her debts\" and kept us hostage in the house until she was done. For days we had no food and were afraid to leave. His mother was a diagnosed schizophrenic on top of the drug use and would regularly hallucinate. She threatened to kill me on multiple occasions and chased me out of the house with a butcher knife. \n\n\nI never really picked the best boyfriends when I got older either, probably due to unresolved trauma, though I've attempted therapy many times. I've dated abusive men, either physically or emotionally, no matter how hard I've tried to choose better. Thankfully I've had enough sense not to marry any of them. \n\n\nOne boyfriend took me to a big city to meet and hang out with some of his old friends. While we were there he got arrested for outstanding warrants I didn't know about. I was left at his friend's house where I ended up being drugged and raped. I managed to trick the man into thinking I was going to the bathroom and escaped the house. I wandered around the city I didn't know, dazed and no one would help me. I finally found a hospital and called a friend. \n\n\nI got pregnant at 19 with my first son, and two years later had a second boy. My second son had unexplained health issues that kept us in and out of the hospital for the entire 16 months of his life. They never figured out what was wrong with him. Shortly after, the father of my 2 sons passed away from diabetic complications. \n\n\nThe next bf hung himself, the next died from a drug overdose, and the last died from drinking too much. These were not one after the other, just throughout my life, and some of them were exes at the time they passed, but still people I cared about. \n\n\nI went to school for on and off for 6 years but have no degrees. Due to life, I was never able to finish any program fully, though I did learn a lot. And racked up a disgusting amount of student debt that I will undoubtedly still owe on even after I die. I have 4 children and suffered 4 devastating, late term miscarriages. I try so hard every day to be a good person and good mother. I don't do drugs besides occasional weed to calm my nerves and I do have a few drinks on the weekends, but I stay home and don't party or get wasted. \n\n\nI had a well paying job, around $80k/year with great benefits, but I was being sexually and otherwise harassed. I tried to fight it, but ended up making things worse for myself. I can't go back to that profession for reasons I can't explain without possibly exposing my identity or the company. I've been unemployed since October of 2024 and I have no idea what to do with myself. Work or otherwise.\n \n\nI am now in my 40s and experiencing perimenopause and have gained 70lbs and continue to gain despite changing my diet and walking up to 30,000 steps some days. I can't fit in any of my clothing and hate looking at myself in a mirror. I cry about it daily. I've gotten to point of being embarrassed to be in public or be seen by friends and family. I've let my hygiene slip because who cares? Most times I live in sweats and don't even want to get out of bed. \n\n\nMy current boyfriend has been hiding conversations with another woman, possibly more. I only caught him once, but suspect there is more I don't know, either with the same woman or others. I'm sure it has everything to do with my depression, my weight gain, and my lack of hygiene, on top of the total loss in libido. I've seen the women he looks at on his phone or the ones he sneaks peeks at in public. There's no way he's even remotely attracted to me anymore. But I feel like the one trapped. I have my youngest son with him and he is a toddler. My bf of course pays for everything at this point, so I put up with his indiscretions because what else can I do? I've applied at other jobs for months, and there is just nothing that will pay enough to support myself and my children, or they are looking elsewhere, or they went a different direction, or whatever the plethora of reasons are.  \n\n\nI know there are other people out there that have it worse than me, so I feel bad complaining, but I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like the best thing for everyone would be if I was gone. My children have a great dad, despite his disrespect for me, and aside from the initial sadness they might feel, I just don't think my presence here is worth the effort anymore. I'm tired. \n",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nFor any of you Gold/Platinum members considering flying United to the US, i thought I\u2019d share my recent experience flying MEL-LAX-IAD last week. TLDR; it was surprisingly solid.\n\nI\u2019m Velocity Gold (but then again who isn\u2019t these days) and the trip was booked as a Velocity reward redemption.\n\n- Velocity gold members get United \u201cPremier Access\u201d for free. It\u2019s a product United typically sell but was added to my booking around 24 hours before departure free of charge. It formalises priority baggage, boarding and security (only applicable at big United ports in the US) in their system and is very handy.\n- Departing Melbourne, i knew i had access to the SQ lounge, even though the lounge attendant was super confused when i showed up. She eventually let me in after i showed her my digital Velocity gold card. The lounge itself isn\u2019t anything special but the coffee is excellent and it\u2019s a little nicer than the terminal.\n- Gold members don\u2019t get any special seating privileges so I could only choose from the basic economy seats that were free of charge \n- If connecting at LAX, gold members can use the Premier Access security lane which is a lifesaver at peak periods. I had a 3 hour transit but would have missed my connection without it, even though immigration only took 5 minutes (wtf right)\n- The United Club at LAX T7 is also basic but has pretty good views, free booze (ETA: only really useful before your long haul to Australia \u2026. and even then I\u2019d avoid alcohol entirely) and decent food selection; which is critical because there\u2019s no food at all on your connecting domestic flight. The system didn\u2019t automatically let me in on boarding pass scan, the lounge agent had to do something manually which involved writing down my Velocity number. Although the policy is that you can only use the lounge when transiting to/from Australia, i got the sense that it\u2019s not strictly enforced - but YMMV\n- Priority boarding is also super useful at LAX as overhead bin space is a massive issue. Gold members should be in Group 1 but United have about 6 different passenger cohorts who \u201cpre-board\u201d so it\u2019s not as impressive as i initially thought \n\nFor a non-alliance status partnership i think VA have done a pretty good job of ensuring their elite frequent flyers are well looked after by United.\n\nHappy to answer any other questions if you like.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Title. Some people say if your pro life, your a misogynist. Everywhere I go I see people question why some women are pro life. I'm a ex pro choicer because I realized pro choice is baby murder later on but also because pro choice in practice is misogynistic. Think of it like this, the pro choice movement just subjects women into a corner and makes them believe that the only way to handle their situation is to kill a baby. The pro choice community pretends like their aren't any other options (even though their are). So they can oppress women and keep them in the mindset of thinking that killing their baby is the only way to handle their situation if they can't financially or parentally keep the baby. Not to mention the women who have been forced to abort their children. Dr Anthony Levatino has worked with many high risk pregnancies and have concluded that terminating a baby because of the risk it has for the mother's safety is nearly unnecessary and unrealistic, sure some of those babies did require early births threw C-sections but it never lead to the mother's life in jeopardy. It pisses me off how so many mother's lost their babies because doctors immediately jumped to abortion without giving the babies life a chance unlike Dr. Anthony Levatino. Pro choice doctors and abortionist will see a women with a troubling pregnancy who still wants to keep the baby and tell her to terminate it anyway without offering those women all the best medical care possible (How is that NOT misogynistic?). So many mothers could be with their babies THAT THEY WANTED if it weren't for the misogyny in the pro choice movement. Restricting women from other medical or parenting treatments/options is pure misogyny. It's ironic how a movement made and called to give women more choices and options in their lives, turns out to be a misogynist in feminist clothing that takes women's rights to proper medical care and more. Not to note how abortions increase suicide, drug use, and risk of mental health development in women. Imo, if your a pro lifer, your a misogynist... PERIOD. To the female pro lifers reading (God bless you, your a slay Queen!!), I wanted to ask, what insights do you girls have that show the hidden misogyny in the pro choice movement and practice of abortion? I would appreciate your insight. ",

        "selftext": "So I've been wanting to fix my old ds lite for a long time. About 15-17 years old. Top screen was a little messed up, but overall the image was still visible, the bottom screen was totally cracked and unviewable. So I bought a bottom screen from the HandheldLegends website, got it. And I carefully followed this video guide for the bottom replacement [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfow\\_e5AhpE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfow_e5AhpE) \n\nNote that before my attempt the ds was still able to turn on and off with ease, bringing me to the menu. Also note that I did clean some dirt out of the insides with just a bit of rubbing alcohol, I'm pretty sure it should have been safe with that but I'll point that out just in case its a red flag. \n\nAfter the attempt though, I would go to turn it on, and the top screen would flash before the whole thing going back off. I tried redoing the process, and now, the bottom screen is the one that flashes before it goes back off. I'm worried I messed up the ribbon cable but I'm not sure. I'll redo the process again when I have the time. Tips would be appreciated. Even if the tip is just give up if you think its worth it to keep trying.",

I don't like him as a person, and actively avoid ppl with similar traits to him, like narcissism, childishness, temperamental, alcoholism etc.\n However I'm very aware many men aren't like that. I've also had crushes before all through out my life, but I've never wanted to act on it and even when my crushes had interest in me too. And I already go to therapy, my therapist knows about my dad and has never mentioned a correlation between him and me not dating (which my therapist also knows about).\nI realized I was ace in middle school, I didn't even like the idea of kissing a guy let alone going further than that. I felt that way in highschool as well and still feel that way as an adult. \nRespectfully if anyone has \"daddy issues\" and trauma it's her, and yet she's perfectly capable of dating. So how does that even make sense to say that's the reason I don't date? \nAnyways she really pissed me off and it feels like she invalidated my ace/aro identity. ",

The idea of waiting at the airport without drinking seemed utterly impossible. What absolute misery. I then drank on the flight. And the next day in NYC. And the day after that. Utterly gross.

For example: when we were in Egypt my mom wanted to check the territory  of the hotel and my dad wanted to swim in a pool. And they started arguing about it. They went in different directions and I ran towards the room. I was just sitting and realising the situation. Then they came to me together and apologised. But it was so strange to arguing over this. Now we came to more serious situations. My father often packs his stuff and leaves home. And then in the next morning when i wake up he is just sleeping with my mom. I really don\u2019t know for what they are arguing and immediately make up. My parents love to drink alcohol. And only if I'm lucky (which is unlikely) they won't quarrel while drinking alcohol. Often when they are arguing they are yelling at each other. and when they went to their rooms they started loudly complaining about the whole situation to humiliate each other.

        "title": "Nui Cobalt April Fools is coming! 11 reviews from past years",
        "selftext": "Hello folks, I'm back with a new pre-collection-release post! Nui Cobalt's \"April Fools\" collection of entirely gourmands is coming this Friday (March 28). This collection is deeply-beloved on this sub - so many gourmand-lovers here! (Which is really funny because Forest freely admits that she doesn't enjoy gourmands, so making this collection is always an interesting challenge.) The newsletter will go out tomorrow (Thursday), so we will find out all the details soon. We've had *no* teasers (that I've seen), so it'll be entirely a *sweet surprise* (pun intended).\n\nIf you've been around here for a while, you'll know that while I will praise cardamom to the moon and back, I'm not generally one for gourmand perfumes. I don't enjoy anything too sweet or too literally \"dessert.\" Thus I typically sit out most of the April Fools collection - but I have still managed to try a few from past years, including the *most perfect* cup of tea scent (which is now sadly discontinued, but occasionally they reformulate and rerelease things, so a girl can dream). So as usual, here's my typical pre-release review post of all of the past April Fools perfumes I've ever tried. Perhaps this may be helpful as you make your wishlist. And for all the folks who ADORE the desserty perfumes, we'd all love to hear your thoughts on NCD's April Fools if you're up for posting your own thoughts & reviews!\n\n**A note about my preferences:** I especially love snuggly scents, incense, golden amber, cardamom, black tea, beeswax, non-gourmand vanillas, and white florals (especially honeysuckle, plumeria, tiare, and tuberose; though sadly I am allergic to lilies and jasmine doesn\u2019t usually work on me). I don't like hay, overly sweet gourmands, butter notes, excessive musk, leather, dragon\u2019s blood, patchouli, labdanum, or any really dark scents in general.\n\nSome of these were provided as press samples by Nui Cobalt in exchange for an honest review.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n**Bamboozle: Baklava**\u00a0\\[Diaphanous layers of flaky, golden pastry, toasted pistachio, roasted chestnut, crushed almond, and a generous drizzle of spring harvest honey\\] - I'm truly surprised by how awesome this scent is! I mean, I still didn't keep it (this one was gifted to me by a perfume friend so I could try it) because I don't want to smell like a literal pastry - but this is serious a\u00a0*literal pastry*, an astonishingly authentic, generously-sized piece of baklava! It really is flaky pastry, crisp and golden; a warm brown array of roasted crushed nuts, pistachio foremost but definitely with some others in there too (my nose is getting some walnut as well); and a really pretty golden honey, full-bodied and sweet but not cloying. Husband's complaint, sniffing my wrist, is that this perfume is\u00a0*too*\u00a0strong - he says real baklava smells more subtle - but I doubt many gourmand-loving perfume afficionados would complain about a delicious scent being\u00a0*too strong*. This one is the first and only one I've tried of NCD's especially pastry-y April Fools scents, and it's really kind of astonishing. It makes me wonder if I should try more of this collection just to admire the realism and artistry.\n\n**Blarney: Irish Breakfast Tea**\u00a0\\[The warm, tannic comfort of a proper Cuppa sweetened with a touch of raw honey and smoothed with fresh cream\\] - Friends, she is\u00a0*glorious*. A simple cup of loose-leaf black tea - a different, less incensey tea than in some other Nui Cobalt tea-forward perfumes like\u00a0**Unbought & Unbossed: A Tribute to Shirley Chisholm**\u00a0\\[The fragrance inspired by her is a strong and sophisticated spiced tea with raw honey and Barbados sugar sipped among the sunlit roses of the Brooklyn Botanical Garden\\] or\u00a0**Cloak of Evergreens**\u00a0\\[Snow-covered spruce, iced cedar tips, golden pine sap, icicle musk, and the fading memory of tea by the fireside\\]. There's a purity to\u00a0**Blarney**'s straightforward tea note, and the honey too is uncomplicated, pure honey. The cream note merely makes the scent a bit creamy but not lactonic, so it's a perfectly safe choice even for folks who (like me) sometimes get weird issues with milk or dairy notes. If you want a perfume that's literally the\u00a0*perfect*\u00a0cup of black tea, this is it! (And if Forest ever wanted to make an entire collection centered around black tea, I would be\u00a0*here for it*!) This one was discontinued last year (and you better believe I FSed it before it was gone), but sometimes they reformulate and rerelease things. And if you love black tea perfumes and ever spot this in a destash, snatch it right up!\n\n**Charlatan: French Almond Macaron**\u00a0\\[Crisp-tender pillows conjured from confectioners sugar, finely sifted almond flour, and Madagascar vanilla, united by smooth almond frangipane\\] - Almond almond almond! Covered in powdered sugar. I got this because I adore\u00a0**Arcana Frigg** (now **Frigga**)\u00a0\\[Black tonka bean, raw cashmere wool, French bakery vanilla, soft warm skin, confectionery sugar, and sweet almond\\], and I wanted to see what Nui Cobalt would do with a similar pairing of almond, sugar, and vanilla.\u00a0**Charlatan**\u00a0is definitely its own thing, not trying to be a dupe of\u00a0**Frigg**. It's bold and vivacious almond (both dry crushed almond and smooth almond paste, and you can smell them both), made sweet and playful thanks to the powdered sugar; while\u00a0**Frigg**\u00a0is lighter, more diaphanous, and more snuggly.\u00a0**Charlatan**\u00a0eventually dries down to a cozy almond-tinged vanilla (I especially love this stage, and it's fairly long-lasting - this perfume ends up lasting over half a day on me, which is above average for Nui Cobalt scents on my skin), but its opening is anything but diaphanous. There's no cashmere or skin musk here; instead there's just more almond! If you love almond notes, you have got to try this one.\n\n**Hoodwink: Thai Iced Tea**\u00a0\\[A tall glass of Thai iced tea sweetened with Tupelo honey and swirled with vanilla rice milk\\] - Milky honeyed tea, much closer to\u00a0**Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy**\u00a0\\[Portrait of an extraterrestrial desert and its elusive denizens: dry white sandalwood, Tunisian tea, cracked coriander, cassia bark, amber resin, raw cotton, and combs full of precious honey that few will ever taste\\] from the Bees collection, with its prominent dark honey, than to\u00a0**Blarney** from this collection.\u00a0**Hoodwink**\u00a0is rich golden honey first and foremost, with black tea and caramel-y tonka behind it, and just a touch of creamy milk added. I've never had Thai iced tea so I can't say how accurate it is. This has a bit of a resinous undertone with notes of incense and hay (and now that I say that,\u00a0**Hoodwink**\u00a0also starts to remind me of the fabulous\u00a0**Bee Not Afraid**\u00a0\\[Angelic incense, cirrus clouds, glowing beeswax candles, bedstraw, and honey gathered from an ancient cathedral hive\\]). However, I don't think I like\u00a0**Hoodwink**\u00a0as much as any of the other ones I've mentioned - the honey note is its strongest feature, and it's just a little bit dark and heavy for my taste. Longevity is astonishing, the syrupy honey lasting all day and legitimately into the next morning.\n\n**Perfidious: Wine Poached Pears**\u00a0\\[Delicate d\u2019Anjou pears simmered in a subtly spiced ros\u00e9\\] - It goes on as spiced simple syrup, almost entirely liquid sugar. Within moments, that sweetness is joined by caramelized pear and further amped spices, along with a gentle but definitely alcoholic boozy note. If you like Nui Cobalt's pear and enjoy a very sugary scent, this one is lots of fun and (after the initial simple syrup-heavy opening) well-balanced, but it's too sweet for me.\n\n**Phenakism: Faerie Cakes**\u00a0\\[Tiny cupcakes conjured from lavender-infused sugar, maple sap gathered at the Vernal Equinox, fine almond flour, oatmilk, and rainbow sprinkles\\] -\u00a0*SO CUTE!*\u00a0And oof,\u00a0*much*\u00a0too sweet for me! I'd been hoping for a slightly gourmand-tinged lavender, but it's very much maple cake with some fresh, herbal lavender infused into the frosting. The almond and oatmilk are really prominent; this feels like an extraordinarily fancy gluten-free vegan cake. To its credit, the lavender is absolutely lovely, but the scent overall is way too gourmand for taste, Flormand lovers, rejoice! This one's for you.\n\n**Preposterous: Strawberry Shortcake**\u00a0\\[Sun-ripened strawberries are sliced fresh over soft vanilla cake and topped with a scant teaspoon of whipped cream\\] - Strawberry notes can be hard to execute - they so often end up being strawberry candy rather than fresh berries. This scent wisely leans into the candied-ness of the strawberries to create a frothy strawberry dessert scent: gooey, jammy, candied strawberries topping a thick slice of angel food cake. I've seen some reviews saying that the whipped cream note went strange or sour on their skin, and I'm happy to report that's not the case for me - this whipped cream adds some lightness and airiness to what could otherwise have been a much heavier scent.\u00a0**Preposterous**\u00a0is girlish and frothy and you have to really like sweet scents to like this one. It's really perfect for summer. It does have one of the lowest longevities of all the NCD perfumes I've tried; just a couple of hours at most.\n\n**Prevaricating: Lychee Rose Gelee**\u00a0\\[A lovely bouquet of tart lychee, sugared rose, and a sprinkle of lime zest\\] - The tart, green citrus of lychee paired with the same sugared rose note as in my beloved\u00a0**Love**\u00a0\\[The softest sugared rose dances with resplendent vanilla in flickering candlelight\\], and a hint of lime for extra zest. After reading some reviews I figured this would be a safe scent for this not-very-gourmand-loving perfume enthusiast to try, but I honestly wasn't expecting to like it this much. Which is to say: this is a pretty astonishingly lovely scent!\u00a0**Prevaricating**\u00a0is the perfect marriage of fruity and floral, and there's truly something almost gelatinous to this, like the homemade lime curd I sometimes make in summer. I would call this much more a \"fruit\" scent than a \"dessert\" scent. I wear the heck out of it each summer and I look forward to doing so again.\n\n**Rapscallion: Orange Creamsicle**\u00a0\\[Dark, indulgent vanilla contrasts with the fresh juice and zest of Valencia orange. The two are united with frothy sugared cream\\] - Hay???\u00a0*What?*\u00a0I expected an orange creamsicle, \"sugary and frothy,\" but the \"dark and indulgent\" aspect is what I actually get. This \"dark vanilla\" reads much more like tonka - you know how it often has a caramel effect but can sometimes edge over into hay? And that's mostly what I get: tonka and hay, with a bit of orange juice. It is such a cool take on the ubiquitous orange-vanilla creamsicle scent, but also, I don't personally like hay notes, so I passed this one on to someone who does.\n\n**Scoundrel: Blue Cotton Candy**\u00a0\\[Our blue cotton candy accord is spun from silken tonka, Mexican vanilla bean, sparkling sugar, marshmallow fluff, preserved Damson plum, and barely a twinkle of unripe bergamot\\] - In the vial it smells of blue raspberry and spun sugar, but I'm delighted to say that on my skin it's a lot less sugary than I anticipated based on that vial sniff and also the name (\"Blue Cotton Candy\"). I would say this is on par with\u00a0**Nephophilia (Love of Clouds)**\u00a0\\[A fluffy melange of pink cotton candy, ivory cashmere, silk tree blossoms, blush suede, and steamed vanilla\\] in terms of level of sweetness (so it's definitely not a literal gourmand sugar scent), and (despite its name),\u00a0**Scoundrel**\u00a0is even less literally \"cotton candy\" than\u00a0**Nephophilia**, which has a definite spun-sugar cotton candy vibe to it. This is much more atmospheric than gourmand, and I am really enjoying it. I get more tonka than vanilla, honeyed and slightly gingerbready, with a background purplish fruitiness and a twist of lemony-orangey bergamot to brighten it up. Interestingly, this scent actually reminds me ever so slightly of\u00a0**All Is Calm**\u00a0\\[Sacred temple incense, smooth white oak, Mysore sandalwood, and great-Grandma's traditional figgy pudding\\], one of the discontinued Yule perfumes, because of the plum note. If you liked\u00a0**Land of Sweets**\u00a0\\[Sugared rose petals, blue cotton candy, miniature marshmallows, pistachio ice cream, and a drizzle of white chocolate\\], one of the Yule perfumes, definitely try this one - the blue cotton candy gives a very similar purple-fruity-lemony-tonka vibe. Based on the many rave reviews,\u00a0**Scoundrel**\u00a0was April Fools 2023's most standout new release.\n\n**Wool Over Your Eyes: Rice Pudding**\u00a0\\[A delicate blend of fluffy jasmine rice, precious saffron, vanilla-infused sugar, almond milk, nutmeg, cardamom, and a scant sprinkle of cinnamon\\] - Holy wow, this one made me hungry! Anytime we have leftover rice, we turn it into rice pudding - always with tons of cardamom, cinnamon, almonds, and golden raisins. It's one of my favorite breakfasts (and if we have a lot of it I'll occasionally eat some as an afternoon snack too!) This is unnervingly authentic in the best way. It's a little different than my own specific real-life rice pudding recipe - mine has more cardamom, this one has much more spicy warm saffron that actually reads much like anise - but it's an astoundingly realistic, cozy, and downright delicious scent. Frankly this one might be\u00a0*too*\u00a0realistically foody (delicious though it is!!) for me to regularly wear as a perfume - it's going to make me\u00a0*so*\u00a0hungry for as long as it lasts on my skin!\n\n# Personally...\n\nIf you like black tea perfumes, you simply\u00a0*must*\u00a0try\u00a0**Blarney** if you can find it (and I hold out hope of a new black tea blend this year - maybe a Lady Grey or a black tea + lavender?). And even if you're not a gourmand lover,\u00a0**Scoundrel**\u00a0and\u00a0**Prevaricating**\u00a0are absolute bangers. I love the not-too-sweet tonka + plum + bergamot of\u00a0**Scoundrel**\u00a0\\- it ended up becoming an all year 'round perfume for me, one I wore in situations when I would have reached for a plain vanilla but wanted something with a little more sparkle. Meanwhile\u00a0**Prevaricating**'s lychee + rose is such a\u00a0*perfect*\u00a0hot-weater scent, refreshing and pretty without being at all heavy or cloying. And I remain astonished by the mouthwatering\u00a0**Bamboozle** and **Wool Over Your Eyes**, which both make me suspect that as long as you like gourmands generally, and like the particular notes of any given dessert-pastry-perfume, you really can't go wrong in the April Fools collection. Amazingly well-done gourmands, all of them.",

Many Muslim areas in Bangalore also suffer from poor cleanliness, but people seem uninterested in improving their surroundings. Islam teaches that cleanliness is half of Imaan (faith), yet many Muslims live in dirty environments, throwing garbage right outside their homes and allowing waste to pile up. Instead of working for progress, many are busy trying to impress others. Muslim youth have become so arrogant that they no longer respect elders and are even willing to fight or hit them, showing a complete lack of Islamic morals and values. The increasing drug use among young Muslims and reckless activities like stunt riding on holy nights such as Shab-e-Barat and Shab-e-Qadr show their ignorance of true Islamic teachings. With such issues, it\u2019s no surprise that our community faces struggles and discrimination. It\u2019s time we focus on education, discipline, and unity to improve our future.",

At my worst, I weighed in the high 80lbs and during then, any food I ate just passed right through me whole. It wasn\u2019t until a few months ago when one of my lab tests with a rheumatologist flagged over twice the normal limit for an IBD panel that I decided it was time to get a colonoscopy.\n\nTuesday - All liquid diet + 1st SUPREP dose:\nWoke up feeling super hungry as my last meal the day before was at 4:00pm. Before my first dose of SUPREP, I drank about four 16.9 fl oz water bottles and one 23.7 fl oz Gatorade electrolyte water. These were the only two drinks I had because I\u2019m quite sensitive to the other liquid only options, especially those with artificial flavoring and sugars. My first dose was to be at 6:00pm so at 4:00pm, I stopped drinking liquid to prep my stomach for the large volume intake. At the same time, I poured in the 6oz Suprep and 10oz cold water into the cup provided and I stored it in the fridge. At 5:00pm, I took one 8mg Ondansetron. I will say that the anti-emetic was a life saver during prep as I experienced minimal nausea. At 6pm, I started drinking the SUPREP which was lemon flavored. At first, I thought it was the most delicious thing ever given that for over a year, I\u2019ve only had water to drink. The coldness of it really helps get it down and I also used a straw. Abt halfway through, the sweetness and bitter aftertaste started to get gross and I just kept sipping little bits every minute. The key is to SIP it, not chug. I finished the 16oz in abt 25 minutes. It wasn\u2019t nauseating at all, I just could feel the liquid sitting in my stomach. I am used to feeling that uncomfortable fullness so it did not bother me. I then moved onto the 32oz of water. After one sip, I already felt my tummy rumbling and felt like I had to fart. However, after reading many others colonoscopy stories, I learned to never trust a fart. I ran to toilet and was on there for a good 20 minutes while continuing to drink the water. I will say that with each BM, my stomach felt less full and I started to feel more comfortable. I dabbed with unscented alcohol free baby wipes and applied vaseline with a qtip after each time I got off the toilet but soon found myself back on within 5 minutes. The bouts lasted abt 5 minutes each and soon turned to 10-15 minutes apart. I decided to move my blanket, pillow, phone, iPad, chargers, and more waters to the vacant upstairs bedroom that had its own bathroom so I could be comfortable. Abt 1 hour after the drink and going, I did feel minor lower abdominal cramps that continued until my last go around 4 hours after I finished the dose. During this time, I drank three more 16.9 fl oz water bottles and another 23.7 fl oz Gatorade electrolyte water. At around 10:30pm, I started to feel a minor pressure headache all over my head and felt a little lightheaded. Some minor nausea overcame me as well but I attribute these symptoms to dehydration and also hunger because I was starving!! The BMs stopped around 11:00pm and I decided to shower because I felt disgusting like I had stool all over me (which I probably did). I want to add that I was absolutely freezing and shivering from the time i started drinking the SUPREP to when i fell asleep so the hot shower felt good. I was a bit worried because my last stool was yellow, but still had brown sediment and tiny flakes that sank to the bottom but I trusted that the second dose next morning would do the job. I chilled on my iPad and fell asleep at 12:30am.\n\nWednesday (today) - \n2nd SUPREP dose:\nWoke up at 3:30am super cold and had a sore throat. I was nervous that a cold or virus was coming on and I wouldn\u2019t be able to do the procedure. After drinking water for about an hour, the sore throat went away. I drank 2 16.9 fl oz water bottles and half of the Gatorade water before I stopped drinking at 5am where I also took another 8mg Ondansetron. I premade the second SUPREP dose and put it in the fridge. The second dose was a lot easier for me to get down given I was even more hungry at this point and also my anxiety and nerves were eased knowing I was okay after taking it yesterday. I finished within 15 minutes and again, it hit me right away. At first, it was brown and cloudy so I got nervous but after about an hour, it turned to a clear dark yellow to a light yellow. The urge to go didn\u2019t last long and from 8:30am to 9:50am, I took a nap. I woke up and had to use restroom on and off for abt 15 minutes. I took a shower once I was done going and felt much better. No nausea, headache, or abdominal cramps from this dose. I felt relaxed and just wanted to get it over with. At 11:15am, my brother drove me to the facility for my 11:30am check in\n\nColonoscopy + EGD:\nI wasn\u2019t called back to the pre op until 12:00pm where I changed into a gown and the socks. I could keep my sports bra on. I also want to add I have my nips and belly button pierced which I changed into plastic earring retainers and they said i could keep them in, they didn\u2019t tape them down (keeping in metal piercings would have been an issue). My nurse asked routine questions and I was feeling super confident in myself and the procedure at this point. I got an IV inserted into my wrist because they could find a vein in both forearms (I got baby veins) and then waited for another 30 minutes until the CRNA came in. He was very nice and explained the procedure thoroughly. I expressed my concerns with going under anesthesia for the first time and asked if he could add zofran to my IV. He stated that propofol is already an anti-emetic so I was very very unlikely to throw up. My GI doc came in 5 minutes later to explain the procedure and asked about my GI issue history. I laid in bed for another 5 minutes before my nurse came and wheeled me into the OR. I still felt fine. They asked me to turn over on my left side and put a pad under my head and my butt. It wasn\u2019t I had the mouth guard put in my mouth and saw the CRNA attaching the propofol to my IV that I started to freak out. I took the mouth guard out and turned to the CRNA saying I\u2019m scared and I didn\u2019t want to do it anymore. One of the nurses put the mouth guard back in reassuring me everything would be okay and the CRNA said I\u2019d be out in less than 5 seconds and then wake up instantly. Last thing I remember was hearing my heart monitor racing, seeing the ceiling lights look fuzzy and doubled, and then feeling a fuzzy tingly sensation all over my head.\n\nWake up + discharge:\nNext thing I know I open my eyes to see my brother sitting in a chair next to the bed I was laying in and I asked him what time it was. I sat up and felt a bit groggy and dizzy, nothing nauseating or off though. About 10 minutes upon wake up is still a blur to me but my brother told me I asked him \u201cwhat time is it?\u201d More than 10 times in just the span of 5 minutes lol. I remember the nurse laughing when I asked him and I swear I only asked him once. I also remember asking him to take a picture of me to send to our parents and I ended up having a photoshoot in there haha! I asked the nurse for water as I was so thirsty and it felt so good to drink it. I started coming to my senses after 20 minutes and felt more grounded by then. Still a bit loopy but definitely aware. I want to add that I was VERY gassy during this time but had no pain. Just kept passing toots lol. My brother told me that they had to give me propofol twice because I woke up during the procedure and got agitated. I do NOT remember any of that. I assume I was just moving a lot but definitely not actually conscious. He told me that it took me 45 minutes to wake up and even after the nurse was screaming in my ear to wake up, I still didn\u2019t get up then. My GI came in to show me pictures from my endoscopies while i was still a bit out of it so i couldn\u2019t really remember anything besides him saying they took biopsies from both the EGD and colonoscopy which i would hear the results from in 7-10 days. About 30 minutes after waking up, I was 90% myself and could stand up, dress myself, and walk out on my own. No nausea, no dizziness, no pain. In the car ride back home, I soon turned to 100% and my brother took me to a grocery store so I could grab ingredients for dinner. He also showed me videos and pictures he took when I was in post op and I don\u2019t remember the majority of the things I said! In the various videos, I said \u201cdrugs can\u2019t kill me\u201d and \u201csend this pic to dad because he\u2019ll love it\u201d. It was really funny to see how weird I was acting. It was hard to believe that was even me given I don\u2019t remember most of it. Once I got home, I ate a bowl of cream of rice, blueberries and Trader Joe\u2019s dark chocolate covered rice cakes. It\u2019s currently 6:47pm and I\u2019m feeling great and like my normal self. I have had 2 BMs since coming home and it\u2019s still liquid but with some solid pieces. Other than that, I am super hungry again but will eat later to give my stomach some time to digest the food I ate.\n\nFrom the time I felt the tingly sensation in the OR to opening my eyes in pre op, it was truly less than a second. I didn\u2019t dream of anything. It was exactly like blinking. If you\u2019re scared of getting your colonoscopy or EGD Due to the fear of going under, please don\u2019t be. If I had to do this again, I would 100x. We often let fear hold us back from a majority of things in life that benefit us. And to my fellow emetophobes, the prep and procedure are doable. Do not let the bad scary stories deter you away from getting this done. \n\nMy tips:\n-Follow prep instructions to the T, especially the low fiber/residue diet. The less of that you have, the less stress your bowels will have during prep. If you can on the day before the all liquid diet, don\u2019t eat so much like I did. For my last meal, I had 2/3 cup white rice, 0.75lbs ground beef, and 2 mozzarella cheese sticks and I think that\u2019s what made me have cloudy brown BMs for a while during prep. But still, in the end I was able to get clear yellow because I finished ALL the prep.\n-Chill your prep in the fridge. SIPPPPP your prep. It seems that many people get nauseous and even throw up from their prep due to chugging. I understand it tastes nasty, but if you want to keep it down to have a successful prep (or you have to do the prep all over again if it\u2019s unsuccessful), sip. I didn\u2019t mix it with anything besides water and I didn\u2019t chase it with anything and it was doable for me. Take your time with the prep if you have to. If you have to go 15-30 minutes over the required intake time, so be it. It\u2019s better you get all the prep in than skimp on it.\n-If you\u2019re worried about nausea from prep, ask for Zofran. If you\u2019re worried about nausea from anesthesia, ask for Zofran in IV. I didn\u2019t get any in my IV as the propofol worked as a really great antiemetic and I\u2019m someone who gets nauseous easily. No nausea at all.\n-Discuss your concerns with your doctor, nurses, and other healthcare providers. They understand it\u2019s a scary experience. These are trained professionals who do multiple of these procedures in a day. \n-Breathe. If you have concerns, please contact your doctor\u2019s office. I came close to cancelling multiple times but I pushed through because I knew deep down this was one step closer to a definitive diagnosis after having negative or inconclusive test results for months.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask. I am more than happy to answer and also provide support as I know firsthand what it\u2019s like to be in a vulnerable and scary position. ",

As an example, at least in my society, there has been a certain \"cool\" factor to party culture -- utilization of recreational drugs and alcohol, casual sexuality (depending on the factors involved), pranking others, and so on. Obviously, there is a cultural precedent involved here, looking both in a sense of sociogeography and time, so it might be difficult to pin this down with some level of particularity. However, I am not concerned with any one particular culture or time period, so I will leave it open there for anyone who wishes to share any research. \n\nThank you in advance!",

        "selftext": "After an argument that my dad creates himself he never apologizes. He will call me up randomly while drunk (I know that he's drunk because you can tell when he's been drinking) and start a fight out of nowhere. He spews nothing but hatefulness and judgment towards me and my boyfriend when we have done nothing to him. He also does this to my older sister. He lives by himself and doesnt have a girlfriend/ wife, hasn't had one sense my mom divorced him when I was 9 and I am now 28. Maybe this is the reason? Maybe it's because he grew up without a father figure rarely in the home? Maybe because his mom died when he was young? Whatever the reason may be it gives him no right to treat me and my sister this way. The only recollection I have of him apologizing is the time we got into a car accident because he was drinking and there were seat belt marks on my neck. I was 5. When I cut him off and don't respond to his texts or calls he tries to say that a bill came in the mail at his place for me and I tell him he is lying, he even admits that he lies just to talk to me. Everything is fine and dandy when he's not drinking. My boyfriend and I  LOVE hanging out with him when we get too. I know it sounds like he's an alcoholic but I don't consider him to be one because he only drinks on the weekends. I don't know. I'm trying to move on but I just love my dad so much I don't know what to do. I hate that I have to cut him off. Any advice for me?",

        "selftext": "My mom died from alcoholism. When I arrived at her home I ran into family on my dads side that I have not seen or spoken to in years. \n\nI\u2019m not one for confrontation. I have nothing really against these people. It was comforting to see and hug and grieve along side them. They asked for my number and I exchanged it. Since then my aunt has tried to regularly check on me. Every other day she\u2019s sending me extremely long messages. \n\nI can\u2019t seem to keep up. At first we bonded again over lost time and realized we both had been experiencing similar feelings over my mom. \n\nThen she told me she had went by my moms and picked up her plants. I wanted to cry. This was my moms things and I love plants, I wanted them. She told me she was willing to give me one of the plants. I thought I can\u2019t control this person, I will accept, atleast the plants are being cared for. But I couldn\u2019t help but feel like she stole this from me. She didn\u2019t even ask if it was okay, just told me she took them. I believe she felt entitled to my moms things, above me her own daughter. \n\nMy dads done a terrible job at locking it down. I went by days later and cleaned and picked a few outside pots up. It helped me a little because atleast I had covered some of her plants and could refill them. \n\nFast forward, this aunt is overwhelming me with her txt. She goes on and on from weight loss to Botox, to begging me for her to be in my life. It\u2019s extreme. \n\nMy father also since my mother passed started saying things like he\u2019s going to come by on the weekends and stay with us. I\u2019ve heard these \u201cattempts\u201d at being closer. He even said he was going to go to my other brothers some weekends too. \n\nThese interactions have just shaken me up some and I feel like I\u2019ve taken steps back. My husband pointed out that it\u2019s my people pleasing that has begun again. Im not speaking up when my aunt crossed boundaries and I\u2019m allowing my dad to give me false promises again with no actions. \n\nMy husband said just not to txt my aunt back, but not I feel almost rude for not answering her. Although, I can\u2019t seem to txt her back anymore. The last txt she went on and on about how her friends kids didn\u2019t want anything to do with her friend and how she wAnts nothing to do with these kids anymore. I had to cut contact with my mom after her active addiction got the best of me. I understand all to well cutting off a parent and in no way should a child be blamed. They should do the work it takes to correct the relationship not cry about it.\n\nI don\u2019t have therapy till Friday and this is weighing on me. \n\nI just want to grieve my mom quietly, to feel better, to get better, yet I\u2019m dealing with these pesky relationships with family I was nc/lc with. \n\nWhat do I do? \n\nI think it\u2019s been made worse too because my dad gave all these promises, been acting like he cares and wants to build a relationship back, and then when I sent a video of my kids he doesn\u2019t respond or seem to care. \n\nOpening up old wounds and feeling like I fell for the oldest lie in the book.

        "selftext": "I have ADHD and have been unmedicated my whole life besides maybe a year where I was basically a test dummy for Adderall XR and Vyvanse. I grew up not meeting anyone else who also had ADHD. It was a big thing to me I don't know why to meet others like me or to have a family with another individual who also has ADHD. I was lost growing up and wanted to guide my kid through it. I don't know to be honest. I met a person that was everything to me. And I move across the country for her. A whole year of flying to see her every two weeks it honestly seemed cheaper. Finding a job was hard but I managed after a bit. I have a problem with shutting down, I am avoident when it comes to relationship conflict. Overstimulation is a scary thing and I try to avoid it at all cost I retreat and avoid causing a mess. At least I used to do that.\n\nShe said I was abandoning her and it makes everything worse just as well shutting down makes everything worse. Everything I say is apparently an excuse. If I start crying she gets more upset and tells me I am manipulating her. She is constantly drinking and finishes handles one after another showing signs of alcohol addiction we used to talk about having kids it made me want it so badly. Her father passed a few years ago and mine passed this year and I was sad but she basically told me me that her dad did more for her and his death ruined her life more than mine dying did, I grew up with him not in the picture even tho he wanted to be. It's honestly a point of trauma for me and she knows that. I know she gets really jealous if she can't have it as well. She lost her PC in a sprinkler incident my 2000$+ PC that had to die so it did she fried it in a fit of rage. I had it for a year. I worked 4 years 11$ and hour to build it. Piece by piece gone in the blink of an eye. She is amazing and we used to be attached at the hip. I moved in with her because everything was falling apart at home. I am told what I am doing that I want to make her made that I wanted this to happen. I just keep trying to explain myself that I just want her to love me. I am just a lier and I wanted this. We don't go a week without her coworkers upsetting her, just to have her work herself up explaining it 7 different ways getting more and more upset and threating the coworker in some fashion to me. This process repeats over and over until she thinks about me then. Things I've caused or done over the years come onto me. The fact I was married before we dated or that I looked at porn a year ago. ( TMI We had sex a lot and I often put last her I ask her \"K.O.\" to know when I should stop she kinda goes senseless for a bit.) So blue balls was an issue and I did what I thought I had to. She found out and that was over from there. But that is where it starts and she just flies from there. \n\nTo stop making her mad with my crying I started cutting. It helped a lot. It was easier to stop the overstimulation I guess. Just focused something new. No real plan just lines for thoughts. Calmed up enough to attempt parley with dab hit or something, I learned I just get to were I don't talk about my problems I just focus on acting like everything is ok and just take what she tells me. I tell her I am sorry but that doesn't matter. She already decided I am guilty the point is to not be affected by it and act like she is right and hope everything is ok later. The cutting just covers my left are. She noticed, it just goes on like this. I told her I was suicidal and she told me I am just manipulating her. My friends disappeared after I started dating her. They all existed back in my home state and we're not cool with me leaving. Just as well she managed to hate them all and when I try to get back in touch she gets into this mode where she escalates her tone into a unhinged *aha torture or threat* much like when she talks about coworkers that consistently piss her off. Telling her I am talking to a friend just makes her mad. Everyone I make friends with is somehow scheming or thinking something. I just stop telling her what I am thinking, I don't tell her what I believe my beliefs of celebrating the dead is offensive to her. In my culture telling a memory of someone who is gone is an honor. To die is to know the truth and to experience the full aspect of life. My people do not cry we celebrate life. This is offensive to her and 100% explaining it makes her bring up how important her dad was and how inconsiderate I am. She asked me why I do not morn my father's passing. It was a mistake to answer, I no longer share my culture with her. \n\nI love her but Everytime lately I just think it's all pointless and that everything I wanted is just a joke. I am to old to do this anymore. I wanted this to be it. But it just feels like the end. A lot in my life didn't work out. I just wanted to have this one thing go right. I just expect it now everything always goes wrong or I say something to that makes everything worse. I was going to do it last night. I tried to put her in bed after a fight. She was in the tub, I just walked in toke by the hand hugged her and directed her to bed. As I walked out to find the spot I was thinking of my cat Stevie stopped me literally grabbed my are and hugged me like a teddy bear snuggling me on the couch before I could get my shoes on. I sobbed telling my cat how sorry I was. Passed out snuggling her. Before that everything was so calm. I was so calm it all seemed so rational, Like I was ment to do it. My cat saved my life.\n\nI don't know ",

        "selftext": "Hello, I had uploaded a this earlier but I had just typed everything quickly at work so it seemed confusing to a lot of people. I (18 F) suddenly lost little cousins (13 M) to a car accident while he was riding his bike and the funeral is this weekend. The problem is with my Grandmother (60 F) needing someone to bring her to the funeral. My grandmother is someone who has been distanced from most of the family due to alcohol abuse but has also lost her license recently. My Uncle (Cousins' Father) is incarcerated at the moment (not stating for privacy) and can not get out to attend his son's funeral but has asked for someone to bring his mom (grandmother) because she is wanting to go and so he can have his side of the family there. My mom (38 F) has made it clear she will not be bringing her being she cut her off awhile ago for alcohol use and personal boundaries and has now asked me to be the one to bring her. I have been the peace keeper in the family for awhile and while I typically would there's other issues with this specific situation. The funeral is already bit over 3 hours from where I live (over 6 hours round trip) and if I were to go get her it would add another 30 to 45 minutes to the drive which wouldn't be a problem typically but I work both the day before and the day after the funeral. The day before i work till 7pm and the day after I go in at 8am . My partner who will be accompanying me (mostly for driving reasons cause of personal/medical issues) also works the day before getting home about 11:50pm to 12:15am. The funeral starts at 10am lasting till 12pm then there's a pause with the final ride starting at 2pm followed by a block party probably ending around 6pm to 7pm so already an early leave time and late return time. I also drive a 2  door 2014 honda civic so my car is already cramped when it comes to space. I considered the idea of having her come the night before so I wouldn't have to leave so early to pick her up but I do not trust her not to bring alcohol into my house and vehicle. I understand my family wanting her there but with the business I'm not sure if I want to risk my peace of mind. So would I Be The A Hole if I told my family no to bringing my grandmother.\n\nEdit- Uber is not an option where we are located ",

        "selftext": "Hello, I had uploaded a this earlier but I had just typed everything quickly at work so it seemed confusing to a lot of people. I (18 F) suddenly lost little cousins (13 M) to a car accident while he was riding his bike and the funeral is this weekend. The problem is with my Grandmother (60 F) needing someone to bring her to the funeral. My grandmother is someone who has been distanced from most of the family due to alcohol abuse but has also lost her license recently. My Uncle (Cousins' Father) is incarcerated at the moment (not stating for privacy) and can not get out to attend his son's funeral but has asked for someone to bring his mom (grandmother) because she is wanting to go and so he can have his side of the family there. My mom (38 F) has made it clear she will not be bringing her being she cut her off awhile ago for alcohol use and personal boundaries and has now asked me to be the one to bring her. I have been the peace keeper in the family for awhile and while I typically would there's other issues with this specific situation. The funeral is already bit over 3 hours from where I live (over 6 hours round trip) and if I were to go get her it would add another 30 to 45 minutes to the drive which wouldn't be a problem typically but I work both the day before and the day after the funeral. The day before i work till 7pm and the day after I go in at 8am . My partner who will be accompanying me (mostly for driving reasons cause of personal/medical issues) also works the day before getting home about 11:50pm to 12:15am. The funeral starts at 10am lasting till 12pm then there's a pause with the final ride starting at 2pm followed by a block party probably ending around 6pm to 7pm so already an early leave time and late return time. I also drive a 2  door 2014 honda civic so my car is already cramped when it comes to space. I considered the idea of having her come the night before so I wouldn't have to leave so early to pick her up but I do not trust her not to bring alcohol into my house and vehicle. I understand my family wanting her there but with the business I'm not sure if I want to risk my peace of mind.

        "selftext": "Hey girls! Just a bit of context, within the past year I've had two relationships, two situationships and two short lived dating stages. Tells you all you need to know about my luck with men lol. \n\nBut recently I met a guy who I thought was absolutely perfect, spent around a month exclusively dating him and without meaning to, got very emotionally attached as he was very all over me and kind of selling me the dream. Then he decided to call me out of the blue and say he wasn't ready to date anyone and that he felt nothing. It was that moment that it kind of hit me that I'm absolutely traumatised from all of these horrible relationships in the past because I've never actually processed them.\n\nMy last ex was very emotionally abusive and I only found out after we broke up that he SAd me when I was half conscious after a bad reaction with alcohol and medication. I thought I'd made peace with how he treated me the best I could and so assumed I was ready to start dating again, but everything in that field has gone horribly wrong since I started trying.\n\nSo, this was a very long winded way of asking how did you or how are you managing the healing process and just processing trauma from relationships? I feel physical pain whenever I think about these things for more than a second and so I've never figured out how to face those demons.\n\nIf anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate it, thank you girlies <3",

I've never once in 6 years seen this woman only have a few drinks. \n\nIt's has been the root of many problems over the years. She would go out of her way to pick fights with when she drank. I've seen her throw up on herself. Numerous times she's passed out in the passenger seat on the way home from it. Once about 1.5 Years ago she got so drunk and combative I had to leave and get a hotel. \n\nFast forward to now. I almost never drink. I'll have a few once a month, maybe. My body hates it, I don't care for it personally as it's almost killed me a few times, and it brings out the absolute worst in people. \n\nMay be of use to some people, but she's a SAHM. I pay for everything. But still have to do all the cooking, my own lunches. She's never once in 6 years made me a lunch. But I cook for her daily.\n\nNow to the main issue. I'm at a point now I jist don't wanna be around it at all. It's just not something I want to be around. I've outgrown it, not to mention it's liquid poison. Her mom is an admitted alcoholic. She's said it to my face. Her dad is also an alcoholic. You can see where I'm going with this, I think. \n\nI can't stand being around her when she drinks. IL intentionally distance myself from it. I want her to stop, for the reasons mentioned above. \n\nI don't ask her to do anything. I never tell her she can't do something. Until now. \n\nShe won't even consider it. Flat out told me to my face she has no intent to stop, regardless of her family history with alcoholism, or how it makes me feel. This has been an issue I've brought up many times over the last 3 years. \n\nAm I being irrational? Is it wrong of me to want her to stop with her predosposal to alcoholism, not to mention she already has a dui and we have 2 small boys together. \n\nI feel like I'm going crazy, or I'm being gaslighted to hell and back",

These days, he drinks around 350ml+ of 40% alcohol and is on antidepressants, along with three hypertensive/cardiovascular meds since he\u2019s in stage 2 hypertension.\n\nI\u2019ve gone through every perspective, from self-hate, to blaming alcohol to blaming him. Right now, I\u2019m just filled with anger, but I don\u2019t see that changing. I have other problems, like familial instability and crowded housing, but this is by far my biggest burden.\n\nMy mom is the complete opposite. She\u2019s really religious, and while she had her flaws when I was younger, she\u2019s always tried to be supportive. One thing that always gets to me is how much she\u2019s gone through in her life, and how it\u2019s gonna continue with him.\n\nThis might be a bit morbid, but the only way I see things changing is if some kind of health complication forces him to wake up or never waking up I guess lol. Despite taking all these meds and living a generally unhealthy lifestyle, he doesn\u2019t seem to have any obvious symptoms other than sleeping a lot.\n\nI\u2019m moving countries next year for grad school, and it was a good escape for me during undergrad, too. But I feel terrible for my mom, who\u2019s basically stranded in this situation, especially since my brother will probably move out soon.\n\nI was just wondering how you guys felt as I feel like whenever I have these conversations with people with like \u201cregular\u201d lives they have difficulty understanding or like what should I expect lol ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 3.5 weeks late on my period, I took 3 tests last week- 2 were negative and 1 came out positive but very faint. My current guy ejaculates in me everytime we have sex which is about 3 times per day, however I allowed him because I assumed I was infertile. I had never gotten checked by a doctor yet because I was always scared and unprepared to hear the truth- backstory: I was in a 4 year relationship with a man who had a 3 year old son when I met him, so we instantly were ready to settle down and have kids of our own, but we never succeeded in me getting pregnant all those years, he also grew a very bad alcoholism addiction with a ton of health issues tied to that, so at that point I sort of stopped wanting that with him which is why I never ended up going to a fertility doctor to begin with, I just sort of diagnosed my own self as infertile. I do notice though this current guy I\u2019m with ejaculates like a fire hose, and my last boyfriends ejaculation would be a small amount and curdled/chunky, makes me wonder now if it was actually him and not me. I also have a major chemical imbalance and I\u2019ve had irregular menstruation\u2019s in the past, however the past year it\u2019s been very regular- like on or around the 1st of every month. But my prior irregularity could make my ovulation days more confusing. Ok so I guess my question is, has anyone tested negative on a test and it actually being a full successful pregnancy, and has anyone been unsure with one partner for many years and then miraculously have gotten pregnant with another man? Just wondering if it\u2019s common or if I\u2019m just losing my mind ",

        "selftext": "Location: North Carolina\n\nDo I have a case? I was involved in a motorcycle accident and my fianc\u00e9 was taken to the local trauma center where she underwent surgery for a subdural hematoma (brain bleed). She was transferred to the ICU in critical but stable condition and two days later she was prescribed and started on a blood thinner that caused her brain to start to bleed again. By the time it was noticed 5 days later the accumulation of blood in her brain had caused a herniation and was pressing down on her brainstem and she was progressing towards brain death. I was charged in her death because of the motorcycle accident, and while working on my defense discovered the medication that is contraindicated for a patient with bleeding risk (Heparin). We were not married, and I do not have any right to her estate or to file a wrongful death claim. But am I able to file a claim against the doctor/hospital for my suffering, loss, attorneys\u2019 fees, or anything related to me being charged, when it was their fault and medication error? Furthermore as I go through the medical record you can clearly see where they're trying to cover up their mistake, and since I'm restricted from having contact with the family per the prosecutors\u2019 request I don't know if they may have filed a claim or settled a malpractice or wrongful death suit with the hospital. I want justice for her death, and to clear my name as the cause, and I feel that I should be able to be compensated for their mistake Taking her away from me. I was placed in jail with a $1 million bond, and it took 15 months for it to be reduced to a reasonable amount for me to bail out. It was overcharged initially with second degree murder Because of my profession and a small amount of alcohol and my system .02% But that charge was dismissed, and I was recharged with felony death by motor vehicle and am still awaiting trial. The emotional, and financial toll that this has placed on me and my family is Excessive. Do I have a case? If so, what would it be called, wrongful death, negligence, medical malpractice?",

        "selftext": "This is long so I apologize in advance. I\u2019ll try to summarize as best as possible. I (33F) started dating my boyfriend (34M) in October of 2024. I\u2019ve known him for at least 4 years. He\u2019s an honest, good guy, but he has some history. He\u2019s moved on from the past life he led, and is doing really well for himself. We fell in love within a few weeks and we discussed our future, marriage and kids. In December, Christmas Eve to be exact, he told me that he is in the process of finalizing a divorce. I had no idea he was married previously or actively going through a divorce. He explained that he was a dumb dude in his early 20\u2019s and spontaneously married a girl on a dare (they were both heavy into drugs which is why they both thought it would be funny to do it). Within 6 months they separated and agreed to divorce. He did a bit of a stint in prison so he never got the chance to file for divorce (again, he\u2019s moved on from his past, so don\u2019t judge him on that please.) In 2020 when he got out of prison he immediately filed the paperwork, but there was an issue with the service that was completed to the \u201cwife\u201d. When we started dating and discussing our future, it pushed him to get it finalized. However, it\u2019s now March. I\u2019m a paralegal, and at my last firm I specialized in divorce and family estates. I know how long this process is and what needs to be done, because I have personally done it for clients. I\u2019ve been offering my guidance and advice, my own services, because his \u201cwife\u201d is nowhere to be found (she continued her drug use), yet has responded to his FB messages, going so far as to provide her email and phone number. I\u2019ve located possible addresses for her on my own, in an attempt to help him. His attorney seems to be treating this as though it\u2019s a case initiation, rather than fixing the problem at hand (by filing an amended proof of service), likely to get some money out of him. Anywho, back to the AITA question. Whenever I bring up the divorce to check in on what the status is, it\u2019s gotten nowhere. He starts to get mad when I provide questions to ask his attorney, or provide valuable insight from my personal experience in tricky divorce cases and he blows me off. We have fought about it twice now (pretty bad fights) because he feels I do it to start an argument, instead of taking it for what it is: genuine advice and my trying to help him. He promises to get it taken care of, tells me to let him handle it, but then it falls on his back burner and his responses are just \u201cI\u2019m not an attorney I don\u2019t know!!\u201d I told him that I\u2019m not okay with this entire situation, and that it needs to become his number one priority if our relationship matters to him. He is playing what seems to be a pity-party about how \u201chard\u201d he\u2019s trying to get things done, but in my opinion I feel he\u2019s not doing enough. I\u2019ve told him this, and he again tried to gaslight me saying I\u2019m starting something over nothing. Am I the asshole for feeling unheard, feeling like he\u2019s not making it a priority? If it were me, I would be doing everything and anything to get this done ASAP. And I also wouldn\u2019t have withheld this information from him. Idk, I just feel really shitty. Any advice please?",

        "selftext": "I am a 32M with a nice and challenging tech job and in a successful place career wise in my life. My physical health is also in a decent condition. However, my childhood has been lonely and I have always struggled with socializing and connecting with people. It was also coupled with some generational trauma that runs in the family. All of these things combined affect me to this day, especially in social situations. I just can\u2019t seem to let go of thinking about things like how I am being perceived, is my body language, tonality good and all sorts of thoughts while interacting with someone. This was pretty common for most of life until I started drinking alcohol when I was 27.  Ever since then every time I am in social situations and I am drinking, I am an absolute joy and fun guy to be around. And for obvious reasons, since then I have been dependent on it for socializing to the point that, now I just can\u2019t relax in those situations without liquor in my body. When I don\u2019t, the anxiety surfaces again and my body goes into freeze mode, where everything takes effort and courage. My body becomes stiff, sometimes I feel heart palpitations when I am speaking or sometimes it\u2019s the sudden twitches in my limbs. I also can\u2019t smile without coming off as a weirdo and seeming like I am forcing it. \n\nMy reliance on alcohol has gotten to a point that my liver is getting affected (early stage fatty liver). Although I only drink on weekends but since I am genetically predisposed to having fatty liver, I have reached this point relatively quickly. I have recently moved to a new city and I want to socialize and make friends but without the consumption of alcohol. \n\nI have tried meditating and it does help me to a degree but only momentarily. Once I am out in the real world, it\u2019s the same story. \n\nHas anyone had the same level of anxiety and how did you manage to overcome it (if you did) without relying on alcohol? \n ",

If you can relate to anything I\u2019m about to say, let\u2019s be lonely together. \n\nI want a long term relationship, I definitely like the idea of a long distance relationship, just the feeling of finally meeting the person you love after talking online for a while would be euphoric. We\u2019d have to eventually move to one or the other though, I ain\u2019t getting married on a discord call. But if I were certain you were the one I\u2019d wait as long as we need to make it work.\n\nI want someone to talk to, share emotions with, confide with, be open and vulnerable with and to ultimately love. I want to tell you how perfect your imperfections are and show you how much love you truly deserve. I love romance and the little things that come along with it, like getting excited whenever I get a notification and hoping it\u2019s from you, you catching me staring at you wondering how I got so lucky, getting lost in each others eyes and not having to say a word because we already know what the other person is thinking.\n\nSome things I value in a relationship are:\n* Consideration\n* Honesty\n* Communication - (The most important one imo)\n\nSome info about me:\n* 5\u20195 but 5\u20196 on a good day\n* I\u2019m white\n* Brown hair, facial hair too\n* Australian (I\u2019ve heard people like the accent???)\n* I\u2019m skinny, been working on putting on muscle for a couple months now\n* Funny\n* I have a bit of a potty mouth\n* Not religious\n* Good hygiene\n* Don\u2019t do drugs, smoke, or drink alcohol\n* I\u2019m a bit introverted but once I\u2019m comfortable and feel safe with you I can be very extroverted\n* Homebody\n* I\u2019m a good texter with fast responses\n\nMy interests:\n* You\n* Music - I realllllllly love music, and pretty much all music too\n* Movies/TV Shows - No you don\u2019t get any examples I already gave you that Bladerunner reference in the title\n* Video Games - These have always been my safe space, no matter what they\u2019re there for me. They allow me to switch off any worries I have and just focus on something I can really immerse myself in.\n* Basketball, MMA - Probably the only sports I\u2019m into. I don\u2019t really partake in either but I\u2019d like to start getting into MMA. Catch me on the basketball court though and you\u2019re getting fried unfortunately\n* Gym - Would be cool if you went to the gym too, or are interested in starting\n*  Memes - Haha they\u2019re so funny\n\nEnough about me more about you!\nHere\u2019s some qualities I\u2019d like my partner to have/be willing to do. (not all are must have but just some things I like) :\n* Motherly\n* Loving\n* Nurturing\n* Emotionally intelligent\n* Understanding\n* Reassuring\n* Accepting\n* Sense of humour/funny (I can say some out of pocket things sometimes so you\u2019ll need this)\n* Intelligent\n* Supportive\n\nMy preferences (don\u2019t get offended, everyone has preferences)\n* Around 18-23 years old\n* Not religious\n* Wants marriage one day\n* Wants kids one day (not now)\n* White\n* Fine with you being skinny or having a little chub, just not overweight\n* Don\u2019t mind if you\u2019re taller than me\n* Being from America would be cool (not a must just a preference)\n* Doesn\u2019t drink smoke or do drugs, fine if you drink casually, might let it slide if you\u2019re actively trying to stop these things\n* Someone who doesn\u2019t play mind games\n* Goals and ambitions, I have them and think it\u2019d be cool if you did too\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is so long, if you\u2019ve read all of this for some reason though you clearly want me, oooooooooh someone\u2019s got a crushhhhhhh. If we\u2019re alike or you think I\u2019m cool send me a message and be yourself",

You can even just douse the street with alcohol or gasoline and burn that when they come. Lure them into the barn, put hay and have a back entrance then close them up and burn that as well. \n\nAlso about catching one. Hide a talisman at community house outside the front door and one behind the second door.

        "selftext": "Before anyone comes for me, hear me out: I have no problem with recreational drug use, most of my friends regularly smoke and I've done it plenty of times (only casually, never owned weed for example) plus other drugs in festivals, etc. The big difference is I didn't try anything until I was over 25 and knew the risks, but he's barely 17 and we live in a highly conservative family.\n\nMy brother and his ex-wife are both on work trips, so my nephew is staying with me and my mom for a couple of weeks. There have been suspicions of him using drugs before but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and even defended him from my mom, but last night I found hard evidence that he smoked.\n\nEveryone in the family are extremely conservative in that regard, they'd literally send him to rehab if they found out, plus, no joke, my mom would have a heart attack (one time my other brother mentioned trying weed once and she started crying, so he had to back out even though it was true lol).\n\nPlus, my nephew's mom used to control/abuse him with physical violence up until a few years ago, so I'm afraid of what she'd do to him once she finds out, and how he might react (maybe leave the house without telling anyone where to, ending up in a bigger hole, etc.) This is why I'm not telling anyone about this at the moment, plus, I want him to trust me if he's ever in a big problem. I want him to feel safe with me.\n\nAnyway, this is the background of the situation and why this is actually a bigger deal than what it seems.\n\nI want to talk to him about two things:\n\n1. The immediate consequences that he'd have once our family finds out (because they will)\n2. The future consequences to his life. As of right now, he doesn't do much, just comes back from school and lays in bed until the next day. He quits everything he starts. He's very smart but very lazy, etc etc. I've seen plenty of my friends live that lifestyle and it is so sad, it's a waste of a life in my opinion.\n\nIf he wants to live that way when he grows older, sure, it's his life, but I don't want him to get in that pit just because he didn't know better. Right now he isn't even thinking about university even though he should be starting next semester.\n\nI'm sorry, this is all over the place and might seem silly to some, I just need help to get through him. Right now he still kinda thinks I'm the \"cool aunt\" so maybe he will listen to me but... What kind of words should I say? Should I write him a letter? How would you handle this situation and what would you tell your kids if you found out about this?",

        "selftext": "I have been considering doing 75H/M/S, but am trying to be realistic about WHO I AM and what is realistic for MY PERSONALITY. I recently learned about this idea that there are four core personality \"types.\" I am not a die-hard for personality typing, but I think that some loose structure here can be helpful for figuring out how you want to approach goal-setting. \n\nAccording to the Internet, \"The Four Tendencies framework, developed by Gretchen Rubin, identifies four personality types: Upholders, Questioners, Obligers, and Rebels.\"\n\nI am definitely a Rebel, which means that arbitrary rules are NOT going to work for me, because I will pick them apart and rebel against them. So I plugged this question into ChatGPT: \"Can you describe how a 75 Medium Challenge would be best structured for 'The Rebel' personality type?\" \n\nIts answer is actually very insightful and helpful, and will be a part of what I use to build my plan. Hope this helps others! (And keep in mind that AI like ChatGPT has a massive negative environmental footprint, since it uses way more electricity and water than a typical Internet search, so try to use sparingly!)\n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**75 Medium Challenge for \"The Rebel\" Personality Type**\n\nIf you identify as **\"The Rebel\"**, traditional goal-setting methods can feel restrictive, leading to resistance rather than motivation. The key to making a **75 Medium Challenge** work for you is **flexibility, autonomy, and novelty**\u2014allowing you to make the challenge your own rather than feeling like it's something imposed on you.\n\n# Core Principles for a Rebel-Friendly 75 Medium Challenge\n\n1. **Choice Over Rigidity** \u2013 Instead of strict, pre-defined rules, create a set of guidelines that allow you to decide daily.  \n2. **Variety and Novelty** \u2013 Monotony kills motivation. Keep things interesting with new activities, different workouts, or rotating reading material.  \n3. **Challenge on Your Terms** \u2013 Make the challenge feel like something you're rebelling *for*, not *against*. Frame it as proving that you don\u2019t need extreme discipline, just consistency.  \n\n\n\n# Daily Challenge Elements (With a Rebel Twist)\n\n# \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Movement (Choose Your Own Adventure)\n\n* Instead of a fixed routine, commit to **at least 45 minutes of movement daily** but let it be whatever feels good:  \n   * **Running, Orange Theory, Yoga, Dance, Hiking, Biking, Strength Training, etc.**  \n   * No two days have to be the same\u2014make it *your* choice each day.  \n\n# \ud83d\udcd6 Personal Growth (Without the Boredom)\n\n* Read **10+ pages daily**, but let the book/topic be something that actually excites you.  \n* Rotate between self-improvement, fiction, biographies, or even articles that genuinely interest you.  \n\n# \ud83d\udca6 Hydration (No Arbitrary Gallons)\n\n* Instead of the standard gallon rule, drink **an amount that makes you feel good** (aim for at least 2L).  \n* Customize your drinks: herbal teas, infused water, or sparkling water count\u2014because plain water can be dull.  \n\n# \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Nutrition (Structure Without Restriction)\n\n* Instead of a strict diet, follow **a plant-based, whole-food-focused approach** while allowing flexibility.  \n* A daily challenge could be:  \n   * Try one new plant-based recipe a week.  \n   * Hit a protein goal with **vegan protein powders, legumes, or tofu/tempeh**.  \n   * No extreme restrictions\u2014just balance.  \n\n# \ud83d\udcf8 Daily Proof (But Make It Fun)\n\n* Instead of the same boring progress photos, **document the challenge creatively**:  \n   * Take photos of unique meals, gym PRs, nature from your runs, or daily reflections.  \n\n# \ud83c\udf7b Mindful Indulgence (Because Rebellion Includes Balance)\n\n* Unlike the strict **no-alcohol rule** of 75 Hard, allow yourself **up to 2 indulgences per week**\u2014whether that\u2019s a drink, dessert, or a meal out.  \n* This keeps you from feeling restricted while maintaining mindfulness.  \n\n# \ud83c\udf1f Mental Challenge (Rebel Style)\n\n* Set a daily mindset goal:  \n   * Break a personal rule (\u201cI never wake up early\u201d \u2192 wake up at sunrise once).  \n   * Do something outside your comfort zone weekly.  \n   * Question a belief/habit and test an alternative.\n\n  \n",

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n**warning this might be a long post** \n\nThis post might not make sense as I am reeling from the interaction I just had with my future grandmother-in-law. I 31F and my fianc\u00e9 28M were supposed to get married this summer (2025) but since my other future grandmother-in-law (his fathers side) was diagnosed with lung cancer and was going through chemo, we postponed a year and are now due to be married the same day but in 2026. No big deal to us (important to note-no invites or save the dates had been sent out yet so it is quite literally no skin off anyone\u2019s a**) we would much rather have my nana (yes I already call her my nana\u2014 as she likes me better than my fianc\u00e9 lol) there than have her stay home (as chemo makes you easily susceptible to getting sick). \n\nNow for the nightmare. My future Nan (his mom\u2019s side) \u2026 is\u2026 well the best way to describe her is a toxic boy mom who has *NO SONS*. She has two grandsons that can absolutely do no wrong in her eyes (basically in every situation \u2014 whether she knows the woman or not\u2014it\u2019s ALWAYS the woman\u2019s fault) so as you can guess \u2014 she\u2019s basically put all the blame for this on me. Even though it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. She is 82 and has taken it upon herself to loudly exclaim every time we go up there \u201cwell if it wouldn\u2019t have been for **insert my name here** getting cold feet I wouldn\u2019t be so publicly embarrassed!\u201d *face palm* she is the type of woman that cares more about what people think (EVEN IF SHE DOESN\u2019T KNOW THEM) than literally anything else. For example, she had me go over there to set up one of those smart plugs that can connect to an Alexa so that she could put her living room lamp on a timer because she doesn\u2019t want her neighbors to think she goes to bed at 8 pm (SHES 82!) and the other day we went over there, I went to turn on the kitchen light and it was all the way dimmed down because when she gets hungry at night she dims the kitchen light so that \u201cher neighbors don\u2019t know she\u2019s up eating at 10 pm.\u201d \n\nAnother important thing to note is that she has already ruined/caused a huge scene at her other grandsons wedding because my aunt-in-law didn\u2019t punish the kids because there was some gardening/extra curricular activities and maybe some under age drinking at their wedding. No one was driving\u2014everyone camped out there overnight. She caused a huge scene, blamed the bride and stomped out, getting even more mad that no one ran after her. My fiance was only 10 when this happened so we were hoping she would have cooled her jets by now. But all signs are starting to point to absolutely Tf she has not! lol \n\nSo she\u2019s already mad that she mentioned to her friends in passing that our wedding was *this* summer and is all mad because \u201cwhat will people think!?\u201d I kindly remind her it doesn\u2019t really matter what all your friends at the lions club/trivia night friends think because they\u2019re not f-ing invited. I gave each close member of our family a certain amount of invites because weddings be hella expensive and she\u2019s already chosen hers. Save the dates are in the process of going out and the guest list has already been set. Now, she\u2019s also been all bent out of shape because shes the type of woman that wants to do it \u201cher way or no way\u201d and I politely tell her every time she suggests something \u201cthank you for the idea! I\u2019ll consider it!\u201d Which is getting considerably harder as she continues to push and push at me. She\u2019s mad that we didn\u2019t invite the other grandkids (who my fiance hasn\u2019t seen since he was 10) and they\u2019re not butt hurt because they don\u2019t know us. She\u2019s mad that the great grandkids on that side are not in our wedding.. again we\u2019ve never met them (AND THEY ALL ARE NO CONTACT WITH HER BECAUSE SHES LIKE THIS) she\u2019s mad that since we\u2019re renting our place settings that I\u2019m choosing not to have spoons because nothing we\u2019re serving requires spoons \u201cbut that\u2019s not a proper place setting\u201d (\u2026 like okay but it\u2019s saving us 650 dollars\u2026) she\u2019s tried to gas light *my* mom into talking about the wedding with her/taking her side just to spite her daughter (my MIL) she hates basically everything I\u2019ve chosen \u2014 even though my fiance was a part of every single one of said decisions. She\u2019s told a couple other family members that she will have to \u201cbite her tongue\u201d when it comes to certain things. And we are a blended family (my future MIL and FIL have gotten divorced and are both remarried) and she HATES my future FIL. She\u2019s also a borderline alcoholic and when she gets a few too many glasses of wine in her\u2014 she will absolutely cause a scene. She\u2019s lost a ton of friends because she can\u2019t keep her mouth shut when that liquid courage hits. \n\nIf it were up to me I\u2019d sedate her before the wedding but \u2026 well it\u2019s not up to me. She\u2019s already told me she hates my dress, I\u2019m too skinny (she\u2019s mad that I\u2019ve lost a little weight and now I\u2019m smaller than her \u2014 SHES SO TINY) she just constantly puts me down. Today she told me brides are supposed to be blushing not pale and sickly looking. Which I inherently am not, I\u2019m south East Asian (fair skin but still MORE MELANATED THAN HER non the less) she\u2019s also pouting because I don\u2019t want to wear her wedding dress as my something borrowed. And has been making veiled threats since I *politely* turned down her offer\u2026 so WIBTA for having my MOH sedate her and put sunglasses on her? Weekend at Bernie\u2019s style? \n\nThank you for letting me rant/panic type here  ",

        "selftext": "Third generation employee. My grandfather started the business with my grandmother as a ma/pa shop. They struggled but made ends meet. When my Dad was in his early 20s they made him a one third partner with no buy in.\nMy Dad and his second wife took the business from being in debt to a top brand name in their niche manufacturing business. With my parents divorced my Dad signed custody over of my sister and I to my mother. My Dad did not fight the move our custody( he said it was a different time than when girls went with their mother early 90s). My sister and I came to visit every summer and alternating holidays. Whenever we came up to visit he proudly walked us around and showed off what he has accomplished. In reality for a guy who failed a couple grades in school and still cannot compose an email he really did make a name for himself and grew the business beyond my grandparents wildest dreams.\nMy sister and I both graduated college and took great jobs after college still away from our Dad and hometown. He tried and tried to get us to work there. Tried for years.\nAfter I went through a horrible break up I went through horrible depression. Drank too much and lost my way.\nMy Dad said come back home and stay a year. Get out of your situation and start over. If you don't like being home after a year it will have made me feel complete that at least one of you tried to work the family business.\nThat was 18 years ago and I have been working for him ever since.\nTragedy stuck our family the first year I was home and my sister tragically died. It was devastating. I was newly sober( alcohol never touched drugs) and I went on autopilot for a few years. I was devastated, trying to keep it together and pushed it all down. My Mom died of a broken heart six years after she died and I lost it. I drank myself into the hospital after not leaving my room for two weeks pretending I had the flu. I struggled with survivor guilt and got sent to rehab. I was out of work a few months. My Dad always made me promise him I would come back to work because he needed me.\nI was college educated and able to bring a lot of ideas and implement improvements over the year that benefited the company. Still he always kept me at a lower hourly wage. Last year was my best year making 55k and that doesn't come close to compensating me for my true contributions. I figured my day would come when I was the owner and justified my poor compensation that way. My Dad never handed me anything and watched me live paycheck to paycheck all while owning three beautiful homes, a fleet of expensive vehicles, toys, you name it he has it. Once about ten years ago I cried and told them I didn't have enough money to pay my fuel bill for winter. They paid it without question but literally that's all they did for me. I have two boys. Grandsons to him in a male dominanted industry. He had daughters now he had grandsons. He tells them they are the future of the business all while having a minimum relationship with him. My 14 year old says Grandpa hides behind the God card and treats you like shit. He's not wrong.\nThe time has come for him to retire and he tells me he wants a million dollar down payment and monthly payments for 25 years.\nI literally have 400 in my checking and 20k in 401k. Literally he knows I don't have that.\nI'm left with little options. I'm a third owner of the property the business sits on but I have no stake in the business.\nI know I'm worth more than this. I have twenty years left till retirement and I know I need to go figure out other employment.\nI don't understand why he even kept me there 18 years if he was going to make ownership completely unattainable. I'm crushed and feel like a sucker for wasting all my good working years late 20s, 30s, and early 40s giving my blood sweat and tears to something I can't afford to buy.\nI've taken the last few days off work to figure out a way forward but I just cannot believe the failure of my decision making.\nOther pertaint information. I was extremely close with my grandparents. My grandfather would come visit me everyday up until he died in his 90s and would have me help him with work projects. My grandmother was my best friend. My Dad knew how much it meant to them that I worked there and was willing to give up on other career options to keep a generational business going.",

I am sensitive to the fact that this might be an undesirable trip for many drivers and don't want to screw with their acceptance rate, so normally I schedule longer trips in advance.  \n\nHowever, for this trip, the scheduled price is 2-3X the price of what it would be if I ordered a normal, on-demand ride.  (Highly variable - I've seen wait-and-save fares under $50 and scheduled fares over $180 for the same trip.)  At that higher rate, the extra cost just isn't worth being able to have a beer or two at the event, so I would just drive myself and abstain from drinking.\n\nI would love to hear the community's perspective on what they would rather I do in that situation: order the ride normally and risk dinging someone's acceptance rating, or just don't use a ridesharing app for the trip and drive myself.",

        "selftext": "I don't want to reveal a ton so this is going to be quite abridged.\n\nMy parents had me at 18, I am the eldest, and my parents clearly resented having me.  They were never meant to be a couple, they fought 24/7, but got married \"for the kids.\"  My dad physically abused me, starting when I was 4.  My mom was emotionally neglectful and apathetic, I was basically just in the way all the time and she had no interest in me.  My sister is 2 years younger and she received much the same treatment, but less physical punishments.\n\nWhen I was 10, my brother was born.\n\nAround 14, my sister made a sex abuse allegation against our dad.  Police were involved but it never went anywhere.  My parents stayed together, but my dad emotionally checked out at this point.  The physical abuse stopped, he retreated to the basement or out of the house, and did not engage in any way.  It was like living with a zombie. My mom became an alcoholic.\n\nWhen I was 16, I ran away for good.  My parents cut me off after I refused to come home.  I was dead to them.  My brother was 6. Shortly after I left the house, my parents divorced. Sister went to live with dad, and brother went to live with mom in another state.\n\nMany years go by with little contact. I'm late 30s now.  I've had very little, superficial contact with my brother and I want to reconnect with him.  I'm realizing now, from his perspective, it probably looks like I abandoned the family and caused our parents to divorce.  I worry he has been blaming me for giving up on them.  Lately I've got the bright idea of writing him a letter explaining why I had to leave, and apologizing for abandoning him. But in order to articulate why I had to leave, I would have to reveal my abuse. It's the only way to express the gravity of why I felt it was the only option for me. But he likely is ignorant to all of it.  He has a good relationship with our parents.  He regularly hangs out with our dad, and has on occasion invited me.  I always deflect and find a way out of it.  It looks like I am avoiding our dad, and he must wonder why. I don't know if he is aware of the sex abuse allegation - he was 4 when it happened - and I do not know if my sister revealed anything.  I would not reveal it to him myself, I feel like it is not my story to share.\n\nI worry that if I tell him how I was treated, it will forever taint his picture of our parents, and I don't want to take away the relationship he has with them.  But I ache to connect with him.  I can never forgive my parents fully, and my siblings I feel like are the only family I have.\n\nIs this a really stupid idea?  Should I talk openly with him about the past before he was born, or should I keep it to myself?",

Let\u2019s get into some **real exam prep** today with a few high-yield questions and detailed rationales to help you lock in key concepts. These are the kinds of questions you **WILL see** on the NHA exam \ud83d\udc47\n\n# \ud83d\udd39 Question 1: Infection Control\n\nA medical assistant is preparing to assist with a procedure on a patient who has **Clostridium difficile (C. diff)**. Which of the following infection control actions is required?\n\nA) Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer  \nB) Don a surgical mask  \nC) Use sterile gloves  \nD) Wash hands with soap and water after the procedure\n\n\u2705 **Correct Answer: D) Wash hands with soap and water after the procedure**  \n\ud83e\udde0 **Rationale:** C. diff is a **spore-forming bacterium**, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers **do not kill spores**. The only effective method is **thorough handwashing with soap and water.** This is a high-yield infection control fact for the exam!\n\n# \ud83d\udd39 Question 2: Anatomy & Physiology\n\nWhich of the following body systems is primarily responsible for **producing movement, maintaining posture, and generating heat**?\n\nA) Skeletal  \nB) Nervous  \nC) Muscular  \nD) Endocrine\n\n\u2705 **Correct Answer: C) Muscular**  \n\ud83e\udde0 **Rationale:** The **muscular system** works with the skeletal system to produce movement, stabilizes joints/posture, and plays a role in **thermoregulation** by generating heat during activity.\n\n# \ud83e\udde0 Quick Study Tip of the Day:\n\nIf you're getting overwhelmed by all the content, focus on **one core section per day** (like A&P, patient care, or infection control) and rotate through them weekly.

        "selftext": "I have been separated from my husband. Caught him in dating sites in the past, he lies all the time and he is an alcoholic. Things came to blow about a month ago and I told him I want to separate. \n\nCaught him lying again last night. He was on toddler duty and looked wasted. I asked him if he had been drinking and he said no. He just took a gummy. Well this morning was his turn to get toddler up and ready for school and of course he overslept so I had to take over. \n\nAfter he left for work, I went into his room and sure enough I could smell liquor. He had been probably up all night drinking. I went off on him for lying and drinking while taking care of our son. I'm just so done. I dont even want to try marriage counseling although my husband wouldn't go anyway.\n\nI was upset and told my mom and she started siding with him saying marriage have problems and we should work it out for the sake of our son. Even after I told her about the cheating, lying and alcoholism. Her marriage to my Dad sucks and they stick it out so she thinks I should too. I thought she would be supportive. I'm upset and then she sends me this text: \n\n\"I have never seen *** drunk but I'm not around him all the time and I'm not saying you're not telling the truth but I just have never seen that part of him. Okay I'm done with this conversation now **** because I knew you'd blow up you are very emotional and you always have been.\"\n\nWow. And then she proceeds to say I'm tearing our family apart and im going to break my son's heart and basically I should just get over it. \n\nI'm sad, mad, confused as to why she would say such hurtful and dismissive shit to me when she knows I'm struggling. Ugh, just had to vent. Now my husband and I are in a huge fight and now my mom and I. I feel so alone.\n\n",

        "title": "I'm allergic to the fillers in Levothyroxine. I'm allergic to the fillers in Synthroid. Now, I have to stop taking Levothyroxine for a week before my PCP refers me to Endocronology? WTH?",
        "selftext": "I have 5 diagnoses that covid gave me, including Hashimoto's and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). My MCAS is managed by Hydroxyzine and Fluticasone. I take Omeprazole for Gerd (it's a PPI that also acts as a mast cell stabilizer). I'm one of the unfortunate people who can't tolerate the medications and/or fillers in OTC H1 and H2 antihistamines/histamine blockers. \n\nWhen I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's in August 2024, my TSH was 11.9. I took Levothyroxine 50mcg for two months. It seemed to improve some symptoms. But, it caused itchy, watery, and goopy eyes. And my muscle aches and pains plus crippling fatigue didn't improve. I discussed these symptoms with my doctor. \n\nI asked him to switch me to brand name Synthroid 50mcg four months ago. I thought everything was going great. No more severe muscle aches and cramps. No more severe fatigue. Except now I get flushing/hot flashes, I'm itchy, and my eyes are worse than ever: dry, crusty, and itchy. I have interstitial cystitis that rarely flares up. I thought I had a UTI or a yeast infection for 3 months. Constant burning. Constant urinating. I had to pee every hour, sometimes, multiple times an hour. No UTI. No yeast infection. \n\nI asked my doctor to switch me back to Levothyroxine because I can't tolerate these symptoms. My TSH was 3.0, recently. I asked him to increase my dose from 50mcg to 75mcg due to my symptoms. Now, I've been taking Levothyroxine 75mcg for three weeks. The muscle aches and cramps are excruciating. The fatigue is completely debilitating. I now have gastrointestinal problems that I didn't have before. I have to take Hydroxyzine up to 3xs a daily. And take Fluticasone multiple times a day. My eye problems are gone, though. (Before you ask, I couldn't ask for Tirosint before because I have a cheap ass HMO that we pay an abhorrent amount of money for in monthly health insurance premiums).\n\nI just talked to my doctor and explained all my symptoms. I told him I need to be switched to Tirosint.\n\n>Tirosint and Tirosint-SOL are thyroid hormone replacement medications, designed for hypothyroid patients with sensitivities or absorption challenges. Tirosint is a liquid gel capsule, while Tirosint-SOL is a liquid solution, both free of allergens like gluten, lactose, and dyes.\n\nI told him it's my MCAS. Or I'm having allergic reactions. He said, \"We don't do that.\" As in, he doesn't prescribe Tirosint. He also said, \"I doubt it's the medications. I haven't had anyone other than you who's had these reactions.\" \n\nExcuse me?!.......WTF?!\n\nI continue to tell him my symptoms in detail. Coughing that can last up to 20 minutes. Feeling like I can't breathe. I ask for Singular (Montelukast) and an asthma inhaler (Albuterol) to use for acute attacks. BTW, I don't have asthma. He prescribed both. He said he'll put in a referral to Endocronology and get back to me.\n\nHe calls me 20 minutes later. The Endocronologist told him to tell me to stop taking Levothyroxine for a week. If I stop having the symptoms, then they'll know I'm allergic to the fillers. I have to wait to take Singular until after this little experiment is conducted. After the week is up, I message my doctor, and he'll contact endocronology. And then, hopefully, I'll get my Tirosint. \n\nI'm sorry for my rant, but why the heck is this such a pain in the ass? It's well documented that long covid causes Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and Histamine Intolerance (HIT) issues. It's well known that people react to the fillers in thyroid medications. It's well known that people react differently to different thyroid medications. My doctor doesn't even believe in prescribing T3 and T4 medications. Forget asking my doctor for T3 and anti-TG, \"those aren't needed.\" Despite me asking him for these tests three times. I would've never been diagnosed with Hashimoto's if it wasn't for my own efforts. I'm so sick of this crap. \n\nEveryone thinks, \"Oh, you have Hashimoto's hypothyroidism? Take your levothyroxine, and you'll be fine.\" That's not the case for a significant portion of us. Our thyroid is responsible for so many functions. I had no idea!\n\nI've completely overhauled my diet last year. I switched to an anti-inflammation diet. I cut out gluten, dairy, and sugar for 3 months. It didn't improve my symptoms. After getting MCAS, I switched to a low-histamine diet. I've added foods back in as tolerated. I cut out alcohol, caffeine, coffee, and soda. I lost 50lbs. I had a complete vitamin panel. All my levels are in the normal range. I'm careful with which medications and supplements I take. What else can I do? Any and all ranting and/or suggestions or recommendations is appreciated. I really value this community. Hugs\ud83d\udc9c",

The race will include the following classes:\n\n* Top Fuel\n* Funny Car\n* Pro Stock\n* Top Alcohol Dragster\n* Top Alcohol Funny Car\n* Top Sportsman\n* Super Comp\n* Super Gas\n* Super Stock\n* Stock Eliminator\n\n&nbsp;  \n\nAdditionally, the rescheduled **Right Trailers Top Fuel All-Star Callout** specialty race will take place on Friday evening.\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Summit Racing Series\nIt will be a *relatively* quiet weekend in the Summit Racing Series. **Alien City Dragway** will open its season this weekend. Unfortunately, **Redding Motorsports Park** has had to cancel their ET bracket races once again due to rain, according to their website's schedule. Their original season opener date earlier this month was also canceled due to weather. If there were any races to be livestreamed this weekend, they would be the Team Firebird races at **Firebird Motorsports Park** by [the Track Side Live YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TrackSideLive), but it's been a little over a month since the channel went on an apparent hiatus.\n\n**Carolina Dragway** will be hosting their March Madness Bracket Race, which is both a big money bracket race and an NHRA.tv Challenge race, evidently. It will not count towards their bracket series points. The race pays $20K to win on both Saturday and Sunday, and their flyer advertises \"Wally Trophy to Winner\". I checked and NHRA.com does list the date as an NHRA.tv Challenge date. This looks like an interesting spin on the usual format, turning it into a big money bracket race with Wallys on offer too.\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Catching Up on Last Week\nThis is where I'd like to provide some closure for the events listed in [last week's edition of Around the NHRA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NHRA/comments/1jgz518/around_the_nhra_march_1723_2025/).

        "selftext": "First, this is just how it's worked for me.  I am not your doctor, I don't know if things will be similar for you or not.  Disclaimer over.\n\nMe: Almost 50.  6'4\", I'd been around 250-275lbs for most of my life, and frankly I was fine with that.  I do heavy physical labour, am very active, and walk 13,000 steps per day.  However, over the last 10 years, things crept out of control.  For the first 5, I gained weight every slowly, instead of waffling around 250-275, I was consistently 275, 280, 285...  And then it hit a tripping point.  As I kept aging, extra weight added on, I started having knee problems, back problems.  I'd adjust how I did things to compensate (and in retrospect, just work less hard) which of course just made things worse.  \n\nIn the last 5 years though, something fundamentally changed in my body.  I never felt satiated. Never felt full.  *Ever*.  And when I started eating, I'd get ravenously hungry.  \n\nAttempts to diet?  Might as well tell an alcoholic that they need to have exactly one beer per day for dinner, and a shot each morning, but no more.   Any amount of stress (stress? In today's world?) and I'd crack, and just eat *too much*.  Bored?  Snacking.  \n\n300lbs.  330lbs.  Severe problems with my knees.  Hypertension.  \n\nI often tried diets.  No time for more excersize but that obviously wasn't the issue.  But the same would happen - I'd just be ravenously hungry and fail.  Over and over.  *Hunger is such a bitch*.  \n\nSo, Ozempic.  \n\nAnd Holy shit has it ever been effective.  Immediately, I'm down to eating about a fist sized amount of food, once or twice a day.  Never hungry.  Side effects only present with particular foods - no gas producing food, no fast food, no deserts or candy - but they key is I'm never hungry, and those make me immediately nauseous (and for a long time) so I just don't want them.  \n\nI've lost an average of 2.5lbs a week doing nothing at all different other than eating way less and living my life as usual.  And honestly?  8 weeks of *never feeling hunger* has been amazing.  People can set down a hot, fresh pizza in front of me, and I may eat a slice, but that's all.  Not because I Have To Follow My Diet, but...\n\n*Because I don't want any more.* \n\nI've literally never experienced that before in my life.  Even when I was in the 250-275 range, I didn't really get full.  I love eating. I love food.  And I *always* wanted more. \n\nNow?  I still love food. It still tastes great. I still love eating.  \n\nBut I'm totally happy and content just trying bites of things, eating very small portions.  \n\nI did notice, however, a noted lack of strength initially.  I was forced to change my diet to be almost entirely protein, because my food intake is so low that I needed more body making fuel.  Eating much more protein has been easy too, because my body seems to react directly and positively to it.  \n\nSo, that's how it's been for me, 8 weeks in. Any questions ?",

They are considered high risk still but in general it's more of a \"we need to monitor this more\" without the sense of grave danger/near certainty that a child will have some sort of genetic issue. \n\nIs it because of an increased frequency of ob/gyn visits and monitoring? (As far as I know, my mom only got one ultrasound her entire pregnancy, and this was standard at the time.) Is it because women are better educated today about the use of high risk medications, smoking, alcohol, nutrition, and its affects on a baby? Is it because we are able to screen for genetic abnormalities sooner now/more people elect to terminate early on or go an IVF route if maternal screening shows high risk?\n\nThank you.",

        "selftext": "I (24F) was with my ex (let\u2019s call him Jake) for almost seven years. Our relationship had its ups and downs, but the biggest issue was his drug use. It was a cycle\u2014he\u2019d use, promise it wouldn\u2019t happen again, I\u2019d try to move past it, and then it would happen again. Every time, I told myself, If it happens again, I\u2019m done. But I never was.\n\nThe last time was right before he left for a week-long hunting trip. As usual, I felt like I was just supposed to sweep it under the rug. Then he came back from the trip and suddenly acted like I was a \u201ctotally different person.\u201d Things were tense, but we were still together when Thanksgiving came around. He wanted me to go out of town with him, but considering how rocky things were, I wasn\u2019t comfortable. That didn\u2019t go over well.\n\nAt his family\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner, he completely humiliated me in front of everyone, basically acting like I didn\u2019t belong there. He told me, This is my family, not yours. Get the f** out.* So, I left. And even after that, we still weren\u2019t technically broken up. He didn\u2019t actually end things until December.\n\nDuring the breakup, he constantly guilt-tripped me, asking how I could just throw seven years away like it was nothing. As if I hadn\u2019t spent years trying to make it work, forgiving him, and hoping he\u2019d change.\n\nFor some reason, in early February, I reached out to him, maybe because I missed him, maybe because I wanted closure\u2014I\u2019m not really sure. Since then, he\u2019s been pushing hard for me to move back in and keeps making comments about how everything is always \u201cmy way.\u201d\n\nAfter everything, I\u2019m starting to wonder\u2026 did I make a mistake by trying again?",

I also asked it to turn my unstructured thoughts into a readable story in English.\n\nTo give some background: my mother and I are refugees in a foreign country. My mother works while I study. For our safety, I won\u2019t disclose our ethnicity or the country that took us in. For a while, we lived in a gymnasium alongside homeless people, but once my mother started earning some money, we were finally able to rent a room in a two-bedroom basement apartment owned by a woman. The room was tiny and rundown\u2014the best we could afford\u2014but we were just grateful to finally have a space of our own.\n\nIn the other room, behind the wall, lived a Russian couple. There was something terrifying about their faces and presence\u2014like people who had spent a long time in prison. At first, I tried to be polite to them, but very quickly, they started mocking me because of my ethnicity and skin color.\n\nThey also cruelly imitated my physical disabilities and mental health conditions (I am autistic and have other medical issues). Over time, I became terrified of them. I stopped leaving my room altogether because they would hurl threats at me and call me the most horrific racist slurs. They even described what they would do to me in prison.\n\nAt first, our landlady seemed nice, but she refused to listen to our complaints. She felt sorry for the Russian couple because of the situation in their country and genuinely sympathized with them. Even though she heard them insult us every day, she didn\u2019t see it as bullying or racism. To her, it was just a cultural conflict between foreigners\u2014despite the fact that we never provoked or confronted them in any way.\n\nI had no choice but to pray. And it worked\u2014the Russians moved out. It was the happiest moment for me.\n\nThe basement apartment had constant issues: no proper heating, water problems, a broken toilet, and no lock on the bathroom door. As a young girl, this was a nightmare. But the landlady never seemed in a hurry to fix anything. My mother kept telling me we had to endure it because, for the price we were paying, we wouldn\u2019t find anything better\u2014and sadly, she was right.\n\nIn the meantime, a veteran who had moved from Ukraine became our new neighbor. He was kind, quiet, and responsible\u2014a truly wonderful person. Even though we were from different countries, we understood each other because we both knew what it was like to be refugees. While he lived next door, I finally stopped feeling afraid. It was a good time.\n\nBut one day, he just disappeared without a trace. He took some important belongings\u2014his passport, documents, and keys\u2014but left behind other things like food, some clothes, and dishes. At first, the landlady expected us to track him down (why was that our responsibility?). When we couldn\u2019t reach him and she didn\u2019t receive rent for the next month, she entered his room and simply threw out his belongings.\n\nShe didn\u2019t change the locks\u2014just made a duplicate of her own keys and immediately started renting the room again. I was really worried that something might have happened to him, especially since he had served in the military and could have been dealing with memory issues or PTSD. The landlady never reported his disappearance to the police, and I didn\u2019t have the courage to do it myself.\n\nShe started renting out the room again, but every decent and well-mannered person who came to view it quickly changed their mind after seeing the terrible conditions, despite the tempting price.\n\nBut one day, she finally found someone willing to take it\u2014a man in his mid-30s. One look at him was enough to know that something was off. This place just seemed to attract people like him.\n\nSoon after moving in, he began inviting his alcoholic friends over, keeping us awake at night. That only happened about once a week, but he personally screamed every single night. He slept during the day, then woke up at night and either yelled at someone over the phone, shouted at himself, or blasted football matches at full volume. Even earplugs didn\u2019t help.\n\nSometimes, he seemed completely out of it\u2014making strange animal-like noises and, on one occasion, even urinating on the floor. Other times, he acted somewhat normal. He stole our belongings and food whenever he had the chance.\n\nOn top of everything, he smoked tobacco and weed in the basement all day long. The smell became unbearable, and even keeping our windows open didn\u2019t help. My mother politely asked him not to smoke inside. In our culture, being respectful and polite is fundamental, and we also understood that provoking him could be dangerous. But at some point, it became impossible to endure. So, she finally asked him to smoke outside.\n\n\nWhen he heard this, he went into a rage, screaming that we had no right to tell him what to do. I still remember his terrifying, empty eyes. He yelled at us to \"go back to our country.\"\n\nThe landlady heard the shouting and came down to the basement (she lived upstairs). Instead of helping, she told us that if we didn\u2019t like him smoking in his rented room, we could leave. Then she started yelling at us for keeping the window open in the winter, saying it was wasteful because she was paying for heating.\n\nWe explained that I have serious allergies and breathing issues, and that with all his smoking, we had to keep the window open. She ignored this completely and just repeated that we should leave. However, she didn\u2019t throw us out immediately\u2014probably because she knew that legally, she couldn\u2019t. Instead, she gave us a few months to move out.\n\nFor the first few days after that, I was in complete dissociation. I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. I couldn\u2019t believe people like this existed. I had never experienced anything like it in my short life. Why did she take his side? Was it because he was from her country? Was this just normal in this place? I refused to believe that anywhere in the world, this could be acceptable.\n\nBack home, our house was always clean and smelled nice. But ever since this man moved in, the basement had turned into a disgusting, foul-smelling dump.\n\nMy mother wanted us to apologize and stay. In our culture, women are taught to endure suffering\u2014please don\u2019t blame her for that. But I convinced her that my health would only get worse in this place, and she would end up spending even more money on my medication. Eventually, she agreed to move.\n\nI was the one who searched for housing, contacted landlords, and went to viewings. This responsibility fell on me because my mother never learned the language of this country, while I had already reached a C1 level.\n\nIt was difficult, especially since I struggle with verbal communication. But before making calls or meeting landlords, I spent hours doing articulation exercises to prepare myself. I put on nice makeup and styled my hair carefully to look older and make a good impression. And after a lot of effort, I finally found a great place.\n\nMy mother signed the lease. In just a few days, we\u2019re moving into our new home\u2014a safe place, just for us. I am so proud of myself because I accomplished something I had never done before. It was incredibly hard due to our background and the fact that we\u2019re still in the process of legalizing our stay in this country.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve shared everything and you know what these people put us through, I need your advice. What kind of revenge could I pull off in these last few days?\n\nI considered anonymously reporting my neighbor for smoking weed after we move out, but it\u2019s legal here with a prescription. I also thought about something petty\u2014like hiding a shrimp in a hard-to-reach corner so the smell would drive them crazy\u2014but that might be biological warfare, and I really don\u2019t want to get deported.\n\nDo you have any suggestions?\n\n(P.S. During the worst of this situation, I went to a shelter for people experiencing abuse and similar crises, hoping for advice. But all they could tell me was to keep searching for new housing. The shelter was only for legal residents, and they said, unfortunately, nothing could be done unless this man physically harmed us\u2014like if he had beaten us. So, I guess I have no legal grounds to go to the police.)",

        "selftext": "I (24F) was with my ex (let\u2019s call him Jake) for almost seven years. Our relationship had its ups and downs, but the biggest issue was his drug use. It was a cycle\u2014he\u2019d use, promise it wouldn\u2019t happen again, I\u2019d try to move past it, and then it would happen again. Every time, I told myself, If it happens again, I\u2019m done. But I never was.\n\nThe last time was right before he left for a week-long hunting trip. As usual, I felt like I was just supposed to sweep it under the rug. Then he came back from the trip and suddenly acted like I was a \u201ctotally different person.\u201d Things were tense, but we were still together when Thanksgiving came around. He wanted me to go out of town with him, but considering how rocky things were, I wasn\u2019t comfortable. That didn\u2019t go over well.\n\nAt his family\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner, he completely humiliated me in front of everyone, basically acting like I didn\u2019t belong there. He told me, This is my family, not yours. Get the f** out.* So, I left. And even after that, we still weren\u2019t technically broken up. He didn\u2019t actually end things until December.\n\nDuring the breakup, he constantly guilt-tripped me, asking how I could just throw seven years away like it was nothing. As if I hadn\u2019t spent years trying to make it work, forgiving him, and hoping he\u2019d change.\n\nFor some reason, in early February, I reached out to him, maybe because I missed him, maybe because I wanted closure\u2014I\u2019m not really sure. Since then, he\u2019s been pushing hard for me to move back in and keeps making comments about how everything is always \u201cmy way.\u201d\n\nAfter everything, I\u2019m starting to wonder\u2026 did I make a mistake by trying again?",

        "selftext": "So I applied for benefits, got denied for misconduct. The owner had terminated me for allegedly bringing beer on the premisis. There is footage of another person doing so, I never brought outside alcohol. The other reason was for defacing, with those erasble felt markers, a prep table in the back and printing words that are 'hurtful.' Those words are ASS and TITTIES. \nAnyway, these fearless owners had garnished wages from a coworker for another incident a while back. My overtime was paid at a lower rate than the time and a half. I pulled doubles and what sometimes felt like triples to cover people and these fucking assholes say I'm not a team player when all I did was work, work and work.\nWhat led up to my termination was a night filled with chaos. I was a kitchen manager and had to send one of my bartenders home for being drunk and making a fool of herself. One of my cooks burned the shit out of her hand and had to send her out too. Now it's me and one other bartender closing on a busy ass Saturday night. 2 am comes around and I'm about to set the alarm when I hear loud banging on the glass. Two guys look like they are trying to break the glass. I'm a new father and my only thought is, this isn't my business and I'm not going to confront these dudes. I set the alarm and leave out another way and whatever happens, happens. \nI needed a day to collect myself and had one other manager and a cook cover me for that Sunday. Next thing I know the GM and the owner are blowing up my phone with messages to man up and do my shift and \"that's the business.\" I just want to get my unemployment for a couple weeks, I've already found another job that pays much less and I was getting. How can I approach this?\nThe owners are cheap bastards that expected everything to just work without having to directly coach and help unless it was a lucrative night where the restaurant would get rented out for the night for parties and such. Other than that, we were on our own. ",

I know excess zinc can lower copper, is it the same in reverse? I genuinely feel insane and I'm so, so tired of feeling so awful every day.",

        "title": "My sister won\u2019t leave her abuser and it\u2019s tearing my family apart",
        "selftext": "TW: domestic abuse, drugs, cheating, etc\n\nMy sister has been with the same man for the past 16+ years and they are currently married with 4 children. For as long as I can remember their relationship has always been rocky. There has been a history of domestic abuse, and her husband has been in trouble with the law more times than I can count. Over the years their relationship has gone from bad to worse, and now that I\u2019m older and see the full picture, I\u2019m worried about how this is going to end for her. To give some background they met in high school and have together since. From what I remember as a child, my sister was the \u201cwild child\u201d. Sneaking out with her boyfriend, breaking curfew, drinking, smoking, running away, stealing from parents, etc. All of this was attributed to when she started dating her current husband. \n\nAlong with the bad habits came the abuse. I will be honest, I don\u2019t know the full extent of the abuse due to my sister not fully sharing the details. From what I know, he\u2019s beaten her, choked her, shoved her down stairs, threatened her, etc. After the abuse came the cheating scandals. He cheated on her, and she had also cheated on him. The details on those events are not clear, but were confirmed later on. Shameful to admit, but since she had no intention of leaving him my family did our best to be supportive of her and the kids, but not him. Arguments over the years, and pleas of telling her to leave him were automatically fought back with anger and denial on her end. Over the years she would claim he\u2019s doing better and \u201cproving\u201d himself to be a better man. \n\nBetween the time of her first and second child the abuse was ongoing and she was primarily the provider for their family. It wasn\u2019t until their third child that things seemed to be looking up for them. Both were employed, they were going on family trips, mending their relationship, and this is when they finally tied the knot. It had been a few good years prior to their marriage or at least that\u2019s what it seemed like. They were supporting each other, taking care of their kids, and ultimately happy. \n\nThings took a turn when my sister became pregnant with her 4th child. Tragically her husband lost a sibling, and on top of that was let go from work. As I said, details are hard because my sister keeps the bad parts very private and so I only can share what I know. Somewhere in between the job loss and depression of losing a family member, her husband began using meth. It was later revealed he had also been doing cocaine. While using, he was in contact with a couple (two women) and began an affair. Over the course of a few months my sister had decided she was going to leave him but ultimately never stuck to it. Making every excuse under the sun and pitying him for \u201cgoing through a hard time.\u201d I\u2019ve tried to be the understanding and loving sister that she needs in such a rough period of her life, but it\u2019s starting to feel like I\u2019m going in circles. \n\nHer son had a major health scare in January of this year, and that brought about another reconciliation between her and her husband. This was on top of her being evicted so she was in the process of moving into our parents house with her kids. Over the next few weeks of my nephew recovering, my sister insisted that she and her husband were solid and determined to make things work. My parents were stern with the rule of not allowing her husband to stay with them at their home, so he was staying with his parents. This lasted about a week and half before he was kicked out of his parents and he pleaded with my parents to let him stay. He somehow won over my dad into giving him one last chance at redemption, and that was short lived as well. Currently, he is still unemployed, awaiting court dates, and was banned from my parents house due to returning to his affair partners & the drug use. My sister is still pleading his case, defending him at every turn, claiming she loves him more than anything, and I just don\u2019t know where to go from here. I\u2019ve seen how this affects her kids, and I know they don\u2019t want their dad around anymore with all of the hurt and destruction he\u2019s brought about them. \n\nHow can I help her see what\u2019s best for her family? For herself? I\u2019ve tried the understanding and comforting route, but I feel like I\u2019m just enabling her to go back to him. Divorce papers were filed recently but it\u2019s hard to tell which direction her situation is moving in. She talks to him daily, messages him, and encourages the kids to try and mend their relationship with him. She\u2019s been pushing away my parents and my other siblings because they warn her in a much harsher way that she needs to leave him. I can\u2019t blame them though, but she\u2019s not listening to anyone. I know she\u2019s a grown adult and at the end of the day this is her life to live, but it\u2019s breaking my heart to see her kids in this state and know that she can do so much better. Any advice on what to say or do for her? What will finally wake her up and realize she needs to leave for herself and the livelihood of her kids? \n\nDisclaimer: CPS is involved due to the recurring arrests and drug abuse. All children are currently in a safe environment with my parents as guardians. ",

        "selftext": "TW: domestic abuse, drugs, cheating, etc\n\nMy sister has been with the same man for the past 16+ years and they are currently married with 4 children. For as long as I can remember their relationship has always been rocky. There has been a history of domestic abuse, and her husband has been in trouble with the law more times than I can count. Over the years their relationship has gone from bad to worse, and now that I\u2019m older and see the full picture, I\u2019m worried about how this is going to end for her. To give some background they met in high school and have together since. From what I remember as a child, my sister was the \u201cwild child\u201d. Sneaking out with her boyfriend, breaking curfew, drinking, smoking, running away, stealing from parents, etc. All of this was attributed to when she started dating her current husband. \n\nAlong with the bad habits came the abuse. I will be honest, I don\u2019t know the full extent of the abuse due to my sister not fully sharing the details. From what I know, he\u2019s beaten her, choked her, shoved her down stairs, threatened her, etc. After the abuse came the cheating scandals. He cheated on her, and she had also cheated on him. The details on those events are not clear, but were confirmed later on. Shameful to admit, but since she had no intention of leaving him my family did our best to be supportive of her and the kids, but not him. Arguments over the years, and pleas of telling her to leave him were automatically fought back with anger and denial on her end. Over the years she would claim he\u2019s doing better and \u201cproving\u201d himself to be a better man. \n\nBetween the time of her first and second child the abuse was ongoing and she was primarily the provider for their family. It wasn\u2019t until their third child that things seemed to be looking up for them. Both were employed, they were going on family trips, mending their relationship, and this is when they finally tied the knot. It had been a few good years prior to their marriage or at least that\u2019s what it seemed like. They were supporting each other, taking care of their kids, and ultimately happy. \n\nThings took a turn when my sister became pregnant with her 4th child. Tragically her husband lost a sibling, and on top of that was let go from work. As I said, details are hard because my sister keeps the bad parts very private and so I only can share what I know. Somewhere in between the job loss and depression of losing a family member, her husband began using meth. It was later revealed he had also been doing cocaine. While using, he was in contact with a couple (two women) and began an affair. Over the course of a few months my sister had decided she was going to leave him but ultimately never stuck to it. Making every excuse under the sun and pitying him for \u201cgoing through a hard time.\u201d I\u2019ve tried to be the understanding and loving sister that she needs in such a rough period of her life, but it\u2019s starting to feel like I\u2019m going in circles. \n\nHer son had a major health scare in January of this year, and that brought about another reconciliation between her and her husband. This was on top of her being evicted so she was in the process of moving into our parents house with her kids. Over the next few weeks of my nephew recovering, my sister insisted that she and her husband were solid and determined to make things work. My parents were stern with the rule of not allowing her husband to stay with them at their home, so he was staying with his parents. This lasted about a week and half before he was kicked out of his parents and he pleaded with my parents to let him stay. He somehow won over my dad into giving him one last chance at redemption, and that was short lived as well. Currently, he is still unemployed, awaiting court dates, and was banned from my parents house due to returning to his affair partners & the drug use. My sister is still pleading his case, defending him at every turn, claiming she loves him more than anything, and I just don\u2019t know where to go from here. I\u2019ve seen how this affects her kids, and I know they don\u2019t want their dad around anymore with all of the hurt and destruction he\u2019s brought about them. \n\nHow can I help her see what\u2019s best for her family? For herself? I\u2019ve tried the understanding and comforting route, but I feel like I\u2019m just enabling her to go back to him. Divorce papers were filed recently but it\u2019s hard to tell which direction her situation is moving in. She talks to him daily, messages him, and encourages the kids to try and mend their relationship with him. She\u2019s been pushing away my parents and my other siblings because they warn her in a much harsher way that she needs to leave him. I can\u2019t blame them though, but she\u2019s not listening to anyone. I know she\u2019s a grown adult and at the end of the day this is her life to live, but it\u2019s breaking my heart to see her kids in this state and know that she can do so much better.

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a 32yoM. I got my liver in the wee hours of 12/25/24. \n\nI was socially drinking when I was 20 onwards, with patches of abuse. Most of 2024 leading up to my transplant I was drinking about a 1/5th of bourbon a day (approx 25 drinks by the 1 ounce standard definition). Tbh I still have issue with the whole anything over 1-2 drinks constituting binge or heavy drinking, but whatever. To me, that would mean the large amount of people in our society have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily fair.\n\nI\u2019ve suffered from depression most of my life, started anti depressants when I moved with my wife for her medical training in 2020, and that helps, but I always turned to alcohol when I was sad and lonely. Moving across the country in the middle of the pandemic to a city that was VERY serious about pandemic precautions made it downright impossible to make friends in our new city. My wife had the \u201cluxury\u201d of going to work every day at the hospital, so she was able to maintain normal social interaction. I worked from home, and besides staying connected with my friends by phone and Facebook, my dog was my only friend. I drank a lot; and it went from just pounding cocktails, shots, beers, and/or wine every night to drinking throughout the day. I could walk most places to get anything I needed, so I never had to worry about being too drunk to drive anywhere. I tried therapy when I began taking my antidepressants, but didn\u2019t find it helpful as the doctor was giving me journaling advice and \u201cmake a mental inventory of things that bring you joy,\u201d and I\u2019m sorry, but that doesn\u2019t really help me at all. More power to you if that works.\n\nFast forward to last November (2024), I had been working nights after I switched out of my at home gig, trying to get more sociable and cut back on my daily imbibing. One morning I woke up, and I was yellow from head to toe. Went to the ER (11/22/24 & stopped drinking cold turkey), I didn\u2019t have any other symptoms besides shakes and a dry heave, so I thought I\u2019d just need to lay off the sauce and take some medicine to get over this. Alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and acute liver failure were my diagnoses. Got out of the hospital on time for Thanksgiving, with a prescription for Predisone. Mid December I started filling with fluid and my bilirubin wasn\u2019t going away. Back to the hospital, and upon getting admitted, my MELD score was 38. 2.5 liters of fluid drained from my abdomen. The doctors started to look into the fact that I would need transplant. Over the next week my MELD rose to 40. I was lucky to get matched so quickly, but given priority given to high MELD scores, I don\u2019t really know how \u201clucky\u201d I was. I\u2019m not a religious person either, so I don\u2019t believe in the whole somebody looking out for me.\n\nRecovery sucked the first month or so, but I\u2019m feeling essentially back to normal now. The medications can be daunting, but keeping everything organized and routinely filling up your morning and night meds helps everything flow smoothly. I recently passed my 100 days sober milestone, and my wife has stopped drinking (she only ever had a glass of wine or a single whiskey) and we removed alcohol from our house completely. \n\nI can easily get in my car and go buy something from the liquor store, but I choose not to. I have no desire to go back to drinking to get drunk every single day, but I\u2019d be a liar if I said I don\u2019t miss the taste of a nice rum or a local cider/beer, or a glass of scotch. I\u2019d also be lying if I didn\u2019t say I HATE ultimatums (call it immaturity, I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m being honest about how I feel). I\u2019m trying to stay sober for the most part, but I have been reading a lot of the research that has been published about post transplant relapse, and what I\u2019ve been seeing is that yes alcohol is damaging to the liver, but it\u2019s not an inhibitor to the metabolism of tacro. THC/CBD are inhibitors, and have to be avoided. I see a lot of people on here talk about edibles, and some of my team even said it\u2019s ok, however after my transplant I\u2019ve read more and talked to different members of my team who say no on the green as it can cause toxicity issues with our immunosuppressants.\n\nBetween seeing that people who have transplants for non alcohol related reasons can enjoy the occasional drink or reading that some transplant patients receive different advice from their team, I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s really frustrating. I brew my own beer, I make my own wine, I have a chemical engineering degree, and I\u2019ve always wanted to make my own still for small batch craft spirits. I\u2019ve adapted to the meds, I\u2019ve adapted to never being able to eat grapefruit anymore, no more sushi, no raw oysters (that hurt probably the most), no buffets/salad bars, I\u2019m eating healthier, lost a lot of weight, and I\u2019m staying hydrated.\n\nWe all are here because we drew a shit card in the game of life, and part of why I wanted to share this is not only to share my experience with a subreddit that has helped me learn and cope with a lot, but also to try and speak compassionately to anyone who might be having the same frustrations. I see a lot of people who ask questions on here about the occasional drink or even the option of non alcoholic drinks (0.5% is negligible, unless you\u2019re having a case of them) and I\u2019m getting really tired of reading the judgmental responses to people just trying to get honest responses about their concerns or wanting to regain a semblance of normalcy again. \n\nTotal abstinence is obviously the healthiest option, but not everyone is going to go that route. Life is about risk mitigation in everything we choose. I\u2019ve had to give up a lot of things to support this liver, but I refuse to give up cooking/baking with alcohol, and I went as far as buying zero alcohol mouth wash. Call me a whiner or I\u2019m not realizing \u201cthe gift\u201d I have received, but I\u2019m pissed off about everything I\u2019ve had to change. I can\u2019t smoke (weed or cigars or hookah), edibles are still dangerous for the drug interactions, have to avoid certain fruits and foods, I\u2019m taking more pills than a retirement home hallway; I have to have some sort of vice. Some of us are just like that, and shaming people for being honest about that is the same reason people get turned off from programs like AA/NA.\n\nI\u2019m an organ donor, and whenever I pass on, I want any of my usable organs to go to whomever needs them, and they are free to do with it what they want. Organ availability is always going to be a supply and demand issue until we somehow figure out how to bioprint organs. I have tried and frame my mind to be thankful and honor this deceased person whose liver I received, but at the same time, my new liver came from someone who passed away from addiction. If I was to pass away from graft failure because I would like to have A beer with a friend or A glass of wine with a meal, I would want any part of my body to go to someone, anyone. This is not a meritocracy, and there\u2019s no one looking out us; if there is someone looking out for us, remember that every time a pediatric patient passes while waiting for a transplant.\n\nThe point of this rant is to show anyone else feeling this way that they\u2019re not alone, your addiction does not define you, and to tell people shaming others to stop it. If you\u2019re not running 5 miles a day every day, doing 100 pushup, taking beet juice enemas, and living in a hermetically sealed bubble, how do you know you\u2019re doing everything for your health? You\u2019re not. If someone wants to ask about mild social drinking stop using that slippery slope bs on folks. We\u2019re the only ones who truly know our brains and how strong we are. I have friends that can\u2019t even be in the same room as alcohol without wanting to binge, one of my closest friends struggling with alcoholism admitted to me about drinking vanilla extract in recovery. Drinking is a spectrum and sobriety is an ultimatum, and for a lot of us that in itself is anxiety inducing. \n\nI\u2019m never going back to what got me in the hospital, but I am going to be honest with my transplant team about wanting to explore the future of being able to have an occasional drink, and I will do that with zero shame. We have to give up so much for our transplants, but we shouldn\u2019t have to give up everything.",

My ex wife has lied, gaslit and moral high grounded me for the better part of 4 years since our split. I offered and gave her an amends two years ago that was honest, I took accountability and apologized for the ways I harmed her and made an oath to be better. Or to try. She has now offered me an amends, my request was she bring it all, or bring nothing. If it\u2019s just superficial, cookie cutter nonsense what\u2019s the point? Who is that for? She agreed and I was actually kind of surprised. Well, turns out her false image, her lack of integrity her pure cowardice has won out because she\u2019s walked it back and is now denying me my peace, my vindication and the same closure she received to do her \u201chealing\u201d. I\u2019d like to move on but it\u2019s hard when a co parent you see multiple times a week for the next 14 years (lifetime honestly) is looking at you saying \u201cI\u2019ve done things to you so horrible but you\u2019ll never know\u201d.

        "selftext": "My mom was never a drinker. Our roommate is. My mom gets belligerent and starts acting nuts and if I don\u2019t want any part in it it turns into how I\u2019m such a horrible daughter and so fucking terrible. This time apparently she went to the doctors for tremors and they told her a drink would help with it. She\u2019s already drunk asking if I would be ok with her being an alcoholic??? Like what kind of question is that?? I felt awkward and didn\u2019t know what to say and that\u2019s what set her off. \n\nI\u2019m constantly punished for her own parents short comings. Anytime she acts out she claims she \u201ccan\u2019t help it\u201d meanwhile I walk on eggshells and have been asked why I have yet to kill myself. I have anxiety (brought upon by her screaming at me 24/7) CPTSD, and depression ( depression brought on by my dad getting sick and dying, CPTSD brought on by other deaths close in my life and an abusive relationship I think, not so sure about that one.) and I\u2019m constantly taunted over it. \n\nShe has every excuse in the book. I don\u2019t remember much of my childhood but I was screamed at constantly. I have a vivid memory of her pushing me off of a chair when I was about 6 or  8, I think, and then telling me I had something to cry about then. \n\nShe\u2019s constantly saying how much she\u2019s done for me and I\u2019m an unappreciative bitch. I had anxiety so bad as a child I pulled my hair out until I had bald spots and refused to use the restroom to the point I would have blockages making me sick. Nothing was ever done, no doctor, no whys, just screamed at. \n\nShe\u2019s constantly the victim. She rips me apart because when my dad died I had a very hard time (I was 15) and she punishes me because I didn\u2019t try to get comfort from her. Why would I want the comfort of someone who screams at me every time I did cry? She will also say I was \u201clucky\u201d because I \u201cgot to shutdown and be depressed\u201d while she had to get a job. Again I was 15 and she was in her 40\u2019s. She also has both her parents, granted they both are very elderly. \n\nI\u2019m looking at apartments because I wanna leave so badly and never see her again. My other problem is unfortunately when I was not doing well mentally and using drugs and drinking I got arrested. If you search my name the first thing you pop up is an arrest that sounds awful. That\u2019s a whole other story but lies in it like the type of drugs (I know that may seem like an apple versus orange but they made it sound more scummy than actually what I had due to what I had was a prescription and not straight street shit, which shouldn\u2019t even matter but ppl judge like that regardless.) and that I ran from the cops when I put my hazards on and tried to park in a spot that wasn\u2019t an intersection or the on ramp to the highway. That\u2019s a whole other issue that since I\u2019ve done what the courts wanted and now I am just waiting til my time is up to get my license back. \n\nSo that makes it harder to move into a place in general, I need a close spot to my work obviously. I know I can afford much more than what I pay now because regardless of how big of a screw up I am a great worker who has always gotten promoted at all my previous jobs along with my current one. I\u2019m thinking about getting my last name changed. Ik some of the steps but don\u2019t have a birth certificate or passport, so I\u2019m assuming I\u2019m gonna need one of those. I live in NH if anyone has any tips. I also have two cats under a year old so gotta be pet friendly. This all sucks so much, I\u2019m tired of being hated by someone who is supposed to love me. I don\u2019t understand how she can be so awful to me.",

When hovering over the eject button and having the radio on nothing happens, I've tried grabbing the CD itself, and removing the CD player and seeing if I could do anything then but to no avail. I even pressed the \"reset CD's\" button in the mod settings but it just resets my CD case and my CD rack, but not the CD, I've tried to use MSC Editor but when looking at the mods file and the save game there is nowhere to change the state of CD's being in the CD player. Also a little fun idea for you all, take a drink every time I say \"CD\" in this post, you'll get the IRL Darwin Award achievement by the time you're halfway through lol.

However prior to 2022, I was a hopeless, helpless alcoholic and it culminated in a a night of jail and domestic battery charges at the end of 2021.  6 months later I was convicted of misdemeanor battery, a year of probation, and 6 months of anger management classes.  I also went to AA and got sober in January 2022 and as of today I\u2019m 3 years, 2 months, 25 days without a drink!  I smoothly made it through probation and my classes with perfect attendance, paid all my probation fees up front, and in no time it was done and over with.  Kinda forgot I had it on my record until I unfortunetly got fired froom my company I had been at 9 years.  It wasn\u2019t my fault but I don\u2019t really wanna talk about it because it gets me really worked up and agitated.  Kinda heartbroken over the whole ordeal tbh.  At any rate I put in for door dash monday morning, and still waiting to get the results from the background check.  I really hope it doesn\u2019t disqualify me.  Anyone have any insight?",

        "title": "[M4A] (A Playing as multiple F) (Always Open) Huge Idea Drop: Harem-Themed Anime & Fandom RP Prompts Packed with Story, Action, and Just the Right Amount of Smut! (Anime, Rule 34. Fandoms, Games.)",
        "selftext": "18+ for smut themes.\n\nHey there! I\u2019m Septimus (M) And it\u2019s nice to meet you!\n\nToday I\u2019m coming forward with the desire to RP as an OC in OC x OC or OC x CC harem based prompts.(I\u2019m greedy, I know but what\u2019s RP without wish fulfilment?)\n\nFor my replies I only write in first person and the length of my replies vary from a singular paragraph to a few solid ones depending on how much is given, and how much is going on in a scene.\n\nI figured I\u2019d put a fair warning here that if you reply with low detail, I won\u2019t be rping with you. I\u2019m not looking for a few words as a response. While that might be your thing, that's fine and power to you! It\u2019s just not mine.\n\nI\u2019m someone who likes a nice balance of build-up and story to go along with the smut. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of constant sex, or sex that starts within one or two replies. I also like cute dates and moments, and love to type out action driven moments.\n\nWhat I look for in a partner:\n\nThird Person responses (Unless you're playing a \u201cmain\u201d OC among the harem. Swapping between first person for each character in a harem situation puts too much stress on my tiny brain.)\n\nDon\u2019t take control of my character at any point. Self explanatory but if you write that he does something or has a reaction to something I didn\u2019t write myself it\u2019s majorly off putting and a major red flag for me.\n\nActive: I totally understand that life may not give us time for our hobbies, this is mainly aimed towards the fellas at the back who only are able to write once a week.Sadly for me I finid it kills momentum. I personally try to get at the very least 1 reply out a day, though more is preferred if we both have the time! :)\n\nCommunicative: It kinda links in with the other but if you're not feeling the RP or you're busy. Please just let me know, I\u2019m happy to wait for a reply so long as I have a heads up! Also we don\u2019t both need to be online to RP I generally go off the idea that we both reply whenever we\u2019re able to and the other will get to it once we\u2019re up for it/online.\n\nPlease for the love of god don\u2019t spam me every 5 mins. I get that you can get excited, and I do too! But sometimes it just comes across as extremely pushy. I\u2019m not ignoring you, I\u2019ll get to you ASAP, promise! Sending roleplay ideas/questions is totally fine!\n\nDetailed responses: Anything just around a paragraph (4+ sentences though it depends on the RP AND my response.) is enough, but more is always very much appreciated.\n\nI don\u2019t do group RPS and I don\u2019t play as female characters.\n\nNow to get into the meat and potatoes, I\u2019ll post my kinks and limits. There\u2019s a lot there and not all of them will be applicable to the starters. Aside from Harems. Those are compulsory.\n\n=====\n\nKinks:\n\nHarems \u2013 (Which doesn\u2019t mean playing a bunch of characters at once. If you prefer to play 1 character per scene that\u2019s fine, though the minimum amount of overall characters I\u2019ll take in a harem/RP would be 4 though more is heavily preferred! This kink is currently compulsory for all my rps)\n\nOutercourse (Which is stuff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging, that kinda thing), Risky/public spaces. (Places you can get caught but don\u2019t. Toilet stalls, changing booths, that kinda thing), Facials, Freckles (Face and body), Big, nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle\u2026 just an overall fan of the jiggle if I\u2019m honest), Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, thigh high socks, shower/water sex (places like pools, showers, hot tubs that kinda things, and a Mutual desire for sex. I also like pubic hair as long as it\u2019s not overly bushy, trimmed/slightly bushy is where it\u2019s at. :). I\u2019m also into the rougher stuff. Things like Anal, rough sex. Choking, Spanking all that as well!\n\nLimits:\n\nPregnacy, which also includes lactation (Hard limit, sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, toilet stuff, knife/gunplay, noncon, Gangbangs (reverse gangbangs with females is fine), non hetero pairings, Rimming/pegging, cartoonishly large proportions, NTR, (There could be more that I haven\u2019t thought of, if you\u2019re unsure feel free to ask)\n\nThere could be more that I might be into, that hasn\u2019t been listed so feel free to ask about it and we can work something out. And without further ado let\u2019s head straight into it.\n\n=====\n\nI\u2019ve made an easy access list for you to read through to see if anything piques your interest before you have to scroll through this abundant list.\n\nOf course, due to reddit\u2019s character limits I\u2019ll just be posting a few of the starters below, so you can get a handle on my writing, any other ideas you might be interested in feel free to shoot me a PM and I can send those to you!\n\n=====\n\nAnime/Fandom/Game Ideas:\n\nIdea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.\n\nIdea 1 (II): My Harem (Hero) Academia\n\nIdea 2: One Piece.\n\nIdea 3: Jujutsu Kaisen.\n\nIdea 4: Fire Force.\n\nIdea 5: Demon Slayer.\n\nIdea 6: Attack on Titan.\n\nIdea 7: Fairy Tail.\n\nIdea 8: Naruto.\n\nIdea 9: Bleach.\n\nIdea 10: Fullmetal Alchemist\n\nIdea 11: Chainsaw Man.\n\nIdea 12: Sword Art Online.\n\nIdea 13: Tokyo Ghoul.\n\nIdea 14: Black Clover.\n\nIdea 15: Darling in the Franxx.\n\nIdea 16: Pokemon.\n\nIdea 17: Avatar the Last Airbender.\n\nIdea 18: DC Titans.\n\nIdea 19: Spiderman.\n\nIdea 20: Invincible\n\nIdea 21: Persona (Girls from 3, 4 and 5.)\n\nIdea 21 (II): Persona (3).\n\nIdea 21 (III): Persona (4).\n\nIdea 21 (IV): Persona (5).\n\nIdea 22: Final Fantasy.

From Shiketsu. His power is that of Persuasion. With the power he\u2019s able to convince someone to do something as if it\u2019s their own free will. That being said he\u2019s rather hesitant to use it on other people and due to the stigma around his quirk he\u2019s been seen as an outcast and a freak and has been constantly harassed due to the nature of his quirk.)\n\n(The idea I have for this RP is that the girls of class 1-A will help him come out of his shell and accept that his quirk isn\u2019t the villainous thing that other people have led him on to be. This is more of a \u201cLove Route\u201d though I suppose a more selfish route is also available! Also if you wanted to branch out to internships with heroes like Mirko and Mt Lady that\u2019s available too! It\u2019s currently set after the training camp arc and will continue from there.)\n\nStarter: It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn\u2019t last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.\n\n\u201cMorning everyone.\u201d He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. \u201cToday we\u2019ve got a new student transferring in from another school. He\u2019s from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it\u2019s got the same level of prestige as U.A. but regardless, make sure he feels welcome.\u201d He said, pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem student of the U.A class Bakugo.\n\nWith that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. Nervously my blue eyes sweep over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.\n\nI had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. \u201cMy name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you all.\u201d I say bowing to the class.\n\nSatisfied with the introduction, Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.\n\n=====\n\nIdea 2: One Piece.\n\n(I\u2019m not so sure how I want to approach this one, however I\u2019ll jump in and give it a go. Much like the MHA starter this character will have the power of Persuasion. Having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I\u2019m thinking for now either he makes a crew with characters from the story, or he joins the Straw Hats and goes on adventures with them. (Obviously this doesn\u2019t have to be canon and completely made up as we go.) Either way I\u2019m super keen on this since I love One Piece to death. I also have a list of potential crewmates I can send!)\n\nStarter: Adventure! Freedom, Treasure and Booze! These were all the things a pirate needed in life. And exactly what every pirate set out to obtain. Two years after the events at Marineford where Strawhat Luffy himself took on the government with an army behind him, and the Whitebeard Pirates at his side in order to rescue his brother\u2026 And two years since I felt inspired enough in his absence to set forth on my own.\n\nI gathered up a strong crew and made a name for myself. My alias, Silver Tongue Schwarzer, is a nice title which rolled off the tongue. I had no issues amassing a sizable bounty at 90 million berries. While it wasn\u2019t as grand as other pirates, the world government saw enough of a threat in my power to provide a bounty that large. Of course, had my powers been widely known it\u2019d have rocketed higher.\n\nSo then why was I now sitting at a bar on the Sabaody Archipelago, alone and staring into the amber liquid of booze in a mug? It was simple. Mutiny. Those whom I had trusted most among my crew turned on a dime and after reaching the Archipelago they threw me overboard and turned around. To where I didn\u2019t know and quite frankly after their betrayal I didn\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cDamn them. Damn them all.\u201d I muttered under my breath cursing as I downed the rest of my contents. \u201cAnother!\u201d I called out to the barkeep who approached to fill my mug.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking a little rough there, are you sure you need another?\u201d The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to do. I don\u2019t even know what else to do with myself.\u201d I responded grumpily. \u201cJust fill it up.\u201d I demanded.\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.\n\n=====\n\nIdea 3: Jujutsu Kaisen.\n\n(So I\u2019ve completed the anime and read up to date for Jujutsu Kaisen (No spoilers) and I really enjoy it. I\u2019ve got an interesting idea for a curse ability, my character\u2019s power is basically he emits smells. Mostly for support, however his ability is so strong that he\u2019s unable to turn it off. He always smells great to anyone who smells him, almost like a pheromone. And to cursed spirits it\u2019s a lure. Because of this he wears a lot to cover up his body so he doesn\u2019t let out as much of his scent. He\u2019s in Jujutsu Tech now because he wanted to learn how to use different smells for different things and one day he hopes to be able to control his powers. :) )\n\nStarter: The sounds of fabric ripping filled the air followed up by my swearing as my scent was released into the air. This was bad. My scent leaking out meant that every cursed spirit within a few blocks would barrel down on my position.\n\nIt seemed the time for subtlety was out the window and as such I pulled the large hood back and unzipped my jacket which was usually zipped all the way up to cover half my face. Underneath my body was bare. I mean wearing a large coat all day with extra layers was just asking to make me sweat like a pig. I tossed my coat to the side and threw my gloves along with it.\n\nMy cursed energy seeped out increasing the potency and the range of my smell. My eyes narrowed at the grade three curse spirit which was staring me down. \u201cSleep.\u201d I say clapping my hands together as my scent changed to that of a sleep agent.\n\nThe cursed spirit swayed a little before collapsing to the ground. My smell even caused me to sway a little as I breathed it in, however I had built up an immunity to it. The sounds of more cursed spirits barreling down on my position could be heard all around me as I grabbed my coat and my gloves and made a run for it into a nearby building. I didn\u2019t have time to finish the spirit off before I ran into the building. This would be a better place for me to fight them given that my smell could permeate more efficiently than it would in an open space.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if help was going to come, but for now I\u2019d operate under the assumption that it wasn't.\n\n=====\n\nIdea 7: Fairy Tail\n\n(I love the girls from Fairy Tail, I find them all super hot! As for my character he\u2019s going to be an OC Slayer called a Demon Slayer. My character will use fire based magic to increase his speed and force of attacks. I have some ideas for some missions, but we can keep it pretty casual :))\n\nStarter: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn\u2019t part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.\n\nI had only been part of the guild for a couple of weeks and so far, it\u2019s not been as exciting as I\u2019d hoped, although I figured that it\u2019d pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an eccentric looking orange outfit. \u201cSchwarzer my boy!\u201d He said as he patted me on the shoulder. \u201cHow are you fitting in?\u201d He questioned.\n\n\u201cFine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.\u201d I say to him in response.\n\n\u201cGlad to hear it! You\u2019ve been doing a good job, although I\u2019d like to see you do more.\u201d The male said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take on something more challenging, what do you say?\u201d He questioned.\n\n\u201cYes of course!\u201d I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.\n\n\u201cGreat!\u201d He said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you to who you\u2019ll be working with.\u201d He said as he stood from his spot and led the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.\n\n=====\n\nIdea 9: Bleach\n\n(So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn\u2019t great to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he\u2019s paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.)\n\nStarter: Another boring day at university followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by \u201cFull-fledged\u201d Soul reapers it didn\u2019t leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.\n\nIt was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see its towering form from my position.\n\nIt was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. \u201cDamn.\u201d I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they\u2019d come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.\n\nPushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.\n\nWhen he saw me, the hollow let out a low growl. \u201cYou don\u2019t smell like much, but you\u2019ll do as a snack.\u201d The hollow commented as it charged forward.\n\n\u201cJust evade, buy time.\u201d I commented to myself as I began to leap around the battlefield looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.\n\nThe hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to get bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature\u2019s mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating. I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn\u2019t be enough.\n\n=====\n\nIdea 22: Final Fantasy VII. (Others Can be done! :))\n\n(So this one will be set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, however if you\u2019re looking to do others, I\u2019m more than happy to do so! I\u2019m familiar with them all. Mainly 7 and 14 But this one will be focused on FF VII, since Jessie, Yuffie, Tifa and Aerith are best girls! If you wanted to mix this up with FF 14 and have them transported to Eorzea we can make something up!)\n\nStarter: Midgar. Easy place to find work given you were capable enough. There were a lot of monsters prowling the highways between sectors and a lot of people willing to pay mercenaries to get the job done.\n\n\u201cHiyah!\u201d I called out as I cleaved my blade through the neck of a monster severing its head from the rest of its body and slaying it instantly. It was a tough fight but I overcame it. I panted a little as my muscles relaxed and I slid my blade back into its sheath. The job I was on was simple, kill the beast and return its head to a barkeep in sector 5. I scooped the beast\u2019s head up into a burlap sack and hoisted it over my shoulder before I headed back to the bar.\n\nBy this point I was a rather well-known mercenary. Jobs exterminating monsters were easy to come by and easy enough to complete. Plus, the payout paid for my room and for most of my meals. As I entered the bar I headed up to the counter and placed the bloody burlap sack on the counter. \u201cGot it done.\u201d I say to the barkeep.\n\nThe older man, his hair and beard white with age frowned a little and looked at the bag. The blood splatter on the counter\u2026 which he had just cleaned was enough to let him know that I was serious and he placed the sack full of gil on the counter.\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I say as I picked up the purse. It was lighter than I expected, but even if it was short I wasn\u2019t about to start an argument. In return to my manners, I got a short grunt back.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019tcha forget about disposin of that thing, I ain\u2019t want it.\u201d He said waving his hand dismissively towards the bag.\n\n\u201cRight, I\u2019ll get on that.\u201d I say as I grabbed the sack.\n\n\u201cAn there was a woman lookin for you.\u201d He stated. \u201cSaid she\u2019d be waitin for you in buildin next to the orphanage.\u201d He stated.\n\n\u201cRight, thanks.\u201d I said to the man and headed out, disposing quickly of the severed head in the sack before I headed up to the building in question. I frowned as I peered inside. My eyes looking around for any sign of someone out of place. It did seem a little crowded in the building after all. I was about to announce myself when I felt a hand tap my shoulder and turned to see who it was.\n\n=====\n\nIdea 27: Cyberfuck(punk) 2077.\n\n(Recently I\u2019ve gotten back into Cyberpunk and after watching the anime which broke my heart, I think the world will be an interesting one to RP in, I don\u2019t have too much in mind in terms of story, but I figured we\u2019d have a bunch of mini adventures across the setting of Night City, maybe a gang being built up or something. As for the starter, I\u2019ve left it open ended enough for you to come in any direction, wanna be one of the Tyger Claws? The victim they had cornered? Another Edgerunner? Even a NCPD Officer, Civilian, all of it is open up! :) )\n\nStarter: \u201cGood morning Night City! Another busy night has passed in our beautiful little hamlet! Several corpos have turned up dead, Overdose? Or Corporate espionage? You tell me! Let\u2019s not forget the gang wars breaking out! Everyone wants their own slice of heaven, but it seems they\u2019re more than willing to get their hands dirty for it!\u201d\n\nThe sound of the news broadcast was drowned out by heavy rain as I walked the neon soaked streets of Night City. Boots splashing through neon soaked puddles.This night I had found myself walking beats I\u2019d long since abandoned, what seemed to be a lifetime ago, a different version of myself.\n\nI shook it off, I needed air, and the streets of Watson\u2019s back alleys, a charming concoction of half trash fire, half combat zone filled my nostrils. The pistol on my belt made for an easy-access defence while the old NCPD badge hung heavy in my pocket.\n\nI should have turned it in when I quit, but I figured there was still a use for it here and there. I shook it off and soon the yell of a voice cutting through the heavy rain. I pressed my back against concrete, my eyes seeing four distinct shapes standing around a fifth.\n\nTiger Claws by the look of them, their ink and chromed out mantis blades had some poor person surrounded, the way their taunts echoed off the alley walls made it clear this wasn\u2019t just a polite meet up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my problem.\u201d I muttered to myself as I took a step back before finding a sigh escaped my lips.\n\nOld habits die hard.\n\nI stepped out, my boots splashing a puddle as I took a breath. \u201cFour against one hardly seems fair.\u201d I called out. The gangers turned to face me, their neon-lit tattoos glowed in the rain making them stand out even more.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell do you want Choom? You lost?\u201d Came the growling voice of one of the men.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just out for a stroll, but why don\u2019t we all just take a second to get along hm?\u201d I offered.\n\nThe leader of this merry group sneered, his cyberoptics narrowing. \u201cYou think this is funny? You just signed your death warrant, you gonk.\u201d He snarled.\n\nI shook my head as my hand reached down to my pistol, pulling the piece and cocking it in one fluid motion. \u201cTime to see if I\u2019ve still got it.\u201d I say bringing the weapon up and firing off a shot. As the first shot rang out the alley lit up like a war zone.\n\n=====\n\nIdea 34: Harry Potter.\n\n(So to keep this one interesting I\u2019m thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don\u2019t exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other known people as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too! I do have a reference list for this one as well. Feel free to ask me for that!)\n\nStarter: Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.\n\nThe ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abound about what was really happening.\n\nStepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn\u2019t stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.\n\nGlad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. \u201cI know it\u2019s around here somewhere.\u201d I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.\n\n=====\n\nIdea 36: Multi Fandom/Dimensional hopping.\n\n(So like a lot of these fandoms and can\u2019t pick one? This is the RP for you! Basically, my character will be given an ability/item that\u2019ll allow him to jump to different realms and gain basic powers for each realm. It\u2019s not super fleshed out but it\u2019s a good starting point!)\n\nStarter: My life was pretty usual, and nothing if not stable. Every day I got up, went to college, did my classes then trained afterwards. I wanted to be the best player on my volleyball team so I worked hard for it. Just like anyone else it wasn't like I had larger than life aspirations, I was happy to keep my head down and work hard.\n\nThough a day soon came that changed everything. I home for my birthday when a strange package had arrived, a gauntlet of some kind, I figured it was a strange device that an aunt or uncle had given me thinking I could play games on it. I didn't think too much of it until later that night where, alone in my room I decided to see if I could test it out.\n\nThe glove seemed to form to my hand size, fitting perfectly, and before I knew it a sudden bright light shone from it. When my vision had cleared from the blinding light I realized I wasn't anywhere I recognized, and the gauntlet had changed shape and form.\n\n(Leaving it super open ended to let you pick where we start/who we start with. It's pretty basic so far but gets us stuck in! )\n\n=====\n\nThose are by no means all of the starters and given the size limits of post limits I figured I\u2019d narrow it down to some of the ones I like the most! Feel free to ask me about any of the others! Thanks so much for reading this and I hope to hear from some of you soon! :)",

        "title": "38 F married to 37 M for 11 years with 4 children. Husband frequenting other attractive women on Facebook a couple days a week. What should I do?",
        "selftext": "I was feeling worried and looked at my husband\u2019s Facebook events. He has been distant, inattentive, unaffectionate, etc. I was thinking we were just busy, but was looking for reassurance. His events showed that he has been visiting other young attractive women\u2019s pages, some young women, some local mothers, women from his hometown, his 21 year old nieces friends, some that make no sense but local, and women that post seductive content creators, etc. I feel this is just an iceberg of what he is doing, but he won\u2019t admit it. He told me that he hasn\u2019t been feeling aroused for a while and has been looking at this content to get in the mood to have sex with me. That sometimes he is worried he will not stay hard during sex and has even needed to pray about it. He tells me it\u2019s not me it\u2019s him. That he was weak and being gross. He is doing it to work himself up to be sexual with me, so not to let me down. That he can\u2019t figure out why his sex drive is low and needs this to boost it. He has a history of porn use, but quit when he started working on a closer relationship with God. He chose not to talk to me about this, so we could find ways to reconnect together. He says he loves me and would never cheat on me and wants to spend the rest of his life with me. He rarely touches me other than to play with my hair, which I can\u2019t decide if that is more for him or me, but it\u2019s the only contact that I get from him other then sex and a kiss here and there. I prefer more sensational interactions and have asked, but he rarely provides this. He acts disgusted or unwilling to rub my back or feet. I feel like I should leave him, because this is a sign of him preparing to cheat. I told him I wanted a divorce and have been avoiding him for 3 weeks. He is now trying to manipulate me to get over it. He keeps asking for sex. He keeps asking for forgiveness and doing nice things for me. I don't trust him anymore. I worry I am never going to feel ok again. I am very successful, attractive, and workout. I take care of managing the household and bills. I fix things around the house. I do most of the cooking. I dress nice. Prior I never turn down his sexual advances. Anything he has asked for I have done. I thought we had a great sex life, even though it was only 1-2 times weekly.  I don\u2019t have any friends and focus on my children and husband. I work full-time, but I don\u2019t let that stop me from taking care of my family. Anything my husband or kids need I am there. I don\u2019t want to ruin our family and hurt my children. I am scared to make a bad decision. I hurt so much inside. My husband was an alcoholic and sometimes abusive during the first 10 years of our marriage, he quit drinking 9 months ago. I thought we were finally happy and doing well. We have been working hard on our faith and relationship before this. I feel like I don't know him. I feel broken. I feel not enough, ugly, and old.  What do I do?",

But things got really tough after transferring to a large university. I had a SERIOUS injury that required multiple surgeries and a long recovery, and it wrecked my GPA while I was trying to stay enrolled full time (dumb decision on my end I know). My cumulative GPA is around 3.2 right now, im a junior, and the MAX I can get it to is a 3.5 undergrad (without the aggressive route) \n\nAggressive route: Online classes at my old cc whilst fully enrolled in the large university to try to get up to a 3.7\n\n ECs: I was part of a competitive fellowship (mostly with med students) during recovery, co-founded a high-impact nonprofit during recovery. \n\nPreinjury ECs: did a year of research at a T20, served as president of an honors org, probably about 300 hrs volunteering at a psych clinic and I\u2019m planning on getting MA clinical hours for a year [rent is due :( ]and shadowing soon. I also founded and currently still run a 5 figure business (rent is still due lol). Started a tennis club at my old school too but couldn't tell you how it's going right now.\n\nHaven\u2019t taken the MCAT yet, but I\u2019m preparing for it now. I'm just feeling really hopeless about my GPA and wont be able to afford multiple gap years (Just one). If I get 520+ on MCAT and handle my clinical hours, do you guys think I'd be able to get into a med school (tx applicant too)?

        "selftext": "I'm not trying to complain about a nonexistent issue because it's not like everyone is doing it and it's pretty sparse here, but on music circles online I see a vocal handful of people who start harshly criticizing the new lyricism misread, misinterpret, and downright infantilize the lyrics to the new songs. I totally get it if it's not your thing, but has anyone noticed that the people who do this are the same that owed Isaac's lyrics so much careful attention? Besties isn't a Happy Friendship Anthem and For The Cold Country isn't about sitting and drinking coffee with someone (something I genuinely saw someone say lmao). You can literally get that on a single listen of each song. It really feels like just because it isn't Isaac on lyrics they suddenly stopped caring to even hear what the lyrics are saying and dumb the songs down to nothing, especially when songs like Nancy have themes of things like suicidal ideation--even though that isn't out yet, more serious themes in the singles have been thrown out as well. Sorry for the rant-ish post, but I just wanted people's thoughts on this and to see if anyone else noticed it as well.",

        "title": "Just got dumped over FaceTime for an 8 month relationship and wondering if I'm a bad person",
        "selftext": "(Reading time: 20-30 minutes)\n\nI will try to be as objective as possible in this post explaining the situation. It's made me feel like I'm a crazy person, that I'm the only sane and rational one, and I'm truly left wondering if I'm at fault or a bad person.\n\nIt was the best relationship either of us were ever in, though we both knew it was still toxic. We're both 25, now close to 26. We met on Bumble while she was down in my small town in the south helping her friend move in. She lives in a major city up north. We're like a mirror to each other, besides me prioritizing being logical and her prioritizing her emotions. We started as long-distance. At first I flew up there every other weekend plus days off usually, at maximum 5 weeks apart. Fairytale first date with immense chemistry and a kiss out of a movie, all that. We'd splurge on dates and buy things for each other, do whatever our hearts please on dates, we'd make each other laugh all the time. So many good memories with parades, aquarium trips, small dates, and more. She has a bunch of close guy friends but I realized after I moved to her city and met them all that they're strictly platonic, backed up by the fact that she's known them for years and never once prioritized their time over me, rarely seeing them in the first place, and never without me.\n\nOn our first date she humble-bragged about having cheated on all her past partners for upsetting her, but that she's changed and doesn't do that anymore because, after cheating on her last boyfriend of 3 months with her manager at that time (who I will call AN) and bragging about it to him he overdosed on fentanyl, she has his death date tattooed on her neck. This led to me asking to check her phone one night while I was visiting, and she obliged. Nothing bad up there. I would ask to check her phone once per visit to make sure I wasn't kidding myself until I moved up there, when she asked that I stop doing that, that I should trust her, and I agreed.\n\nI made what I feel is my only serious mistake in the relationship within the first month. We were walking down the sidewalk and a chick was really checking me out. After she's out of earshot I look at my girlfriend and say \"that chick just gave me fuck me eyes\", just blurted out to make conversation, no ill intentions. She informs me that this is actually a manipulative behavior to inflate my value and I agree, so she makes a rule I can't talk about other women like that.\n\nShe had posted me once to her social media, on her Instagram story, for National Boyfriend's Day, 3 months into the relationship. At that time I flew her out to Miami for a fancy vacation with a really nice hotel, cocktail yacht cruise with a sunset view of the skyline, a visit to the Seaquarium, good food, all that.\n\nA pause in the story: R is her longest friend, one she's had since Kindergarten, but she hasn't seen her in 8 years since she joined the military and moved down south. R is 26. When we were down in Miami, while we were eating at a nice restaurant, her friend R was going through a tough time in her life: she divorced her husband due to him being an alcoholic, and the nice house they had bought got hit by two hurricanes and was unlivable, so she was pretty much homeless while her kids stayed with his parents. She was in the bathroom talking about things I don't even want to put on Reddit, self-harming herself in a bathtub and threatening to do the most horrific things I've heard someone threaten to do to themselves. We stay at the table for 3 hours while I help her defuse the situation. So I helped R during a suicide attempt, but apparently she doesn't know that. I also asked about her all the time to my girlfriend to make sure she was doing okay.\n\nWhile we were snapping R, I noticed she had stopped snapping someone named C two weeks ago who I didn't recognize and never heard about. I ask her to go through the chat and she sent him a \"hey with rizz\" filter and her tongue out and hearts while she was at a wedding she was invited to before she met me. She said she accidentally sent that to him, and meant to send that to me, which I believe, since she was drunk and has severe ADHD, sometimes sending things to the wrong people. But she went with it for a few weeks, sending him more pictures with hearts around her head, doing intimate things with him that we do and being way more excited to talk to him than me with a lot more emojis. I forgave her because I hadn't seen her for a while and we were a month apart during long-distance so I guess she got lonely, and it took her another month or two to seem as excited to talk to me as she was to him, but I asked her to block him and she did, she hasn't spoken to him since, and we're past it.\n\nI also noticed AN sent her a dick pic and asked her to hook up, to which she replied with eyes emojis and said \"I can't I'm with somebody I really care about\", she blocked him as well.\n\n4 months in while we're still long-distance and we have a similar situation where her friend from an old workplace invited her out for sushi and she claimed he's gay so she went with him. She said she was surprised to find out he's actually bisexual and considered it a date, but still spoke with him for 5 hours and left to go back to her parent's house where she stays, which I have proof of. She kept all lines of communication open with him afterwards and would ignore when he asked about taking her out to NYC.\n\nShe has sexual trauma, hates sex and doing sexual favors, is anorgasmic (tried all sizes 3-9 in. with 20+ guys and all kinds of toys, nothing), and had sex with me on average once a month. I tried not to complain because I love her even though my ideal amount of sex is as much as possible. This caused problems with her past situationship, citing it was the main reason they broke up besides him being emotionally abusive. She told me I'm emotionally abusive when she dumped me.\n\nWeirdly enough, I had to block the guy who brutally sexually assaulted her and gave her that trauma off of her Snapchat when I was going through it one day while visiting because she was asking if she could hook up with his girlfriend, he asked if I have a schlong to fuck his girl with, and she left it on open. Weird. I told her she could sleep with any woman while we're together but still weird to me.\n\nI move up there 5 months in. Constant complaints about every little thing from her the first two weeks but it dies down.\n\nOur first major argument begins here. We had an amazing NYE, in my opinion. I told her that once and she didn't respond, so I assume she doesn't agree, but that's okay. I invited her to watch the ball drop in Times Square but she wanted local and I complied. We went to see our city's fireworks; though the Uber driver was 10 minutes late and we saw them for only three minutes, at least we saw them on the ride there in a warm car protected from the rain. Standing in the rain for 20 minutes waiting for another Uber was a different story, but we cuddled for warmth and shared one of her cigarettes she got from South Korea. We came back to my place, I ordered $100 of her favorite Asian food to share so she'd have plenty of leftovers, got drunk on Soju and watched our favorite show. We watched the ball drop on Hulu and kissed. Cuddled to sleep. Bliss. New Year's day was a different story. We had a lot of fun early in the day: we drove to the city's nicest park to play soccer with friends, I spent $100 on her at Target and got her a pink drink from Starbucks, and cooked her my favorite dish, shepherd's pie, with ingredients from the best butcher in my city, while she napped. I suddenly had an idea. Relaxing at my place could be dull, since we usually just cuddled, talked, played video games, and tried new food. Her friends that I'd met had made me feel really good in our interactions thus far. So, I had the idea that she could post that I cooked her shepherd's pie to her Snapchat story and, after we ate, we could see people saying things like \"Aw\" and sparking up conversation, for a bit of fun and feel-good before we slept. I had no ulterior motives, genuinely. So, I wake her up from her nap to tell her food is ready, and she comes to get it. I ask her to do me a favor before we eat though, and I ask that. She seems very hesitant. She gives me a disheartened \"okay\" and takes a video of the shepherd's pie and me giving a thumbs up and smiling. She captions it \"Chef \\\\\\[my name\\\\\\]\". I was hoping for something a bit more romantic, and perhaps I'm out of line for this, but I ask if she can caption it with something about her boyfriend cooking her shepherd's pie. She changes it to \"When he cooks you dinner\", and says \"I don't want to put that you're my boyfriend up there\". I'm about to give up and just tell her to forget it, not to post it, but I politely ask \"could you please say something like my boyfriend cooked me shepherd's pie?\" She angrily posts it, takes the food, and stomps off to eat without telling me thank you. I'm a bit taken aback, and go to eat with her. Now, she's usually not one to tell me thank you, but something seems different. I come in and tell her that I'm not sure why she's so upset about something so small, especially after all the fun we've been having the past two days and everything I've done. I walk past her to get napkins. I notice her furiously tapping away to someone on Snapchat, and see really negative stuff up there. We're very transparent with each other, so I ask what she's doing, and she said she's complaining about me to her friend R. I didn't know that she talks bad about me behind my back; she admits to talking to R whenever she doesn't like something I do instead of coming to me. I ask if I can see what she's talking about and she hands me the phone proudly. I can't remember verbatim what she told R, since it was admittedly a bit traumatic for me to see, but it was something along the lines of \"he's being super controlling, he asked me to do so and so and I didn't want to\". Okay, valid, I didn't know that I was being controlling. But R's response threw me for a loop. R tells her \"Girl... run, he sounds like a red flag. He sounds like all my exes lined up. You're in a toxic relationship, and I hate what this relationship is doing to you, as a friend. He's a narcissist for bringing up what you've done the past two days as a way to deflect and I don't feel safe with him meeting my kids\", then proceeds to send her pictures of her kids out of the blue to guilt trip her. I calm myself down for a minute. I tell her she needs to confront R. I tell her it's okay if she thinks I'm a toxic red flag, whatever, but calling me a narcissist and thinking I'm a harm to her children when the only problem I've had in this relationship I can perceive is an off-comment, with no physical element whatsoever, something I would never do, is out of line. She starts crying and says I don't want her to be her own person, then runs to the bathroom and sits in there for an hour. She takes it off of her story. She comes back and we eat the shepherd's pie while watching our favorite show, but at this point this and everything in the relationship is starting to weigh on me so I start crying. She feels a bit guilty and says thank you for the food, how did you do this, trying to talk about the show, etc. I don't let her know but I don't want to be close to her in that moment and feel really betrayed. I tell her the next morning when she needs to go back home that I feel weird since last night but I don't want to let it affect our relationship and I carry her bags to her car for her, kiss her and tell her I love her.\n\nSecond major argument: she asks me one day, \"would you still be in a relationship with me if I moved 3+ hours away for 2 or 3 years for college?\" At this point in the relationship we had only been together for 6 months so I told her no, obviously not, especially since a major reason I moved here to start a new life was to close the gap in our long-distance relationship and be close to her. She was profoundly upset at this response, telling me she believed this is what would happen, so I couldn't help but cry and she resented that I cried for some reason. She goes to every single one of her major friends, telling them what I said. Then proudly reports back that I'm a bad boyfriend for not doing that, because all her friends would do this. She told me it included R, E, and A, though there were a few more. Then, as I try to defend my perspective, which I see (and still see) as the only sane and reasonable one, with my therapist agreeing, she argues with me for 3 days straight over this, to the point where I'm exhausted and my lips are covered in cold sores from stress. This led to two moments that provided a lot of insight into this relationship for me. Firstly, after she came to my apartment that weekend, while we lied in bed cuddling I told her it was crazy that she argued with me for 3 days over that, that it traumatized me, and that she needs to stop telling R our relationship business, because, as it turns out, R's constant egging was the reason she went for 3 days, like she was using a jedi mind trick on her to vent her frustration with her own life into our relationship. She begins sobbing and tells me it's because of childhood trauma from not feeling heard, and that she'll stop telling R our relationship business. As far as I can tell she's upheld this, but I haven't been able to verify this, and honestly I feel after our most recent argument she probably backslid and ranted to her anyways. Secondly, very important, it made me realize something about E and A. If they tell her I'm a bad boyfriend for something as normal and reasonable as not wanting to spend 2-3 years of my life with a girlfriend who lives 3+ hours away when we've been together for only 6 months, it has cemented in my mind that they are nothing but yes men bar extreme cases, and I have had my own further proof from her recent outing with E.\n\nOur third major argument, the one that ended the relationship for her, stemmed from this joke I told the other day, this is what it was as accurately as I can remember, accompanied by my laughing face over Snapchat: \"i walked out of the barber shop at 4 pm and a homeless chick was out front, she saw me, her eyes lit up, she put her hair behind her ear, and said \"good morning\"\ud83d\ude02 i just said mornin\" The joke is that she told me good morning at 4 PM. I love to make my girlfriend laugh and I figured she would find this funny. 8 months into the relationship and things can feel stale over text, with the same type of texts every day, so I try to mix it up any way I can. Obviously I am not attracted to the woman for reasons I feel would be somewhat bigoted to share relating to hygiene and health due to her homelessness, this should not have to be said. She gets angry with me, reminding me of the moment from 8 months earlier when she made a rule about me not talking about other women \"in that way\". Apparently I broke this arbitrary, easy-to-forget rule by telling the joke, and she hammers me for doing it twice now. At this point I have my first strong emotional reaction to any of this besides crying in the relationship thus far. I FaceTime her and say \"what the fuck is wrong with you?\" She says she's at physical therapy (she was) and I say \"I don't give a fuck\" and she hangs up. I tell her that we haven't fought in two months, she's angry over a joke anyone else (hyperbole, most people, at least secure and rational people in my opinion) would find funny, aka nothing, and that she's stirring the pot for no good reason because she craves drama, something I've gotten on her about over and over.\n\nDays go by and I figure it was nothing, at least it was to me. I'm sitting at the counter working. My job asks me to generate 5 leads a day and the time is flexible, so sometimes I end up doing them until midnight. I told her this. She says she's going to play pool with E while she's visiting and I say okay. She gets back and one of the first things out of her mouth is \"I didn't invite you so I could talk about you to E\", to my surprise, since I thought she didn't invite me because she knew I had to get leads. This upsets me a bit so I ask her what she spoke about, she says \"stuff\". At that point I know she was talking negatively about me to E from her body language, and I'm angry, though keeping my inside voice and being rational as I am, so I press her to tell me what was said. Obviously she has the right not to tell me, but I press because I feel it was something I feel I should know since it could be sabotaging the relationship. She tells me (and there's no way to know the truth of all that was said) that she spoke about the argument we had over the joke and that she agrees with her take.\n\nWe go to my girlfriend's game that night where she invited E and A. She acts distant to me whenever we're with a friend, I noticed she gave me a half hug instead of full and asked me to sit in the car while her and E went inside Wawa on the way home later that night. I notice after the game that E is acting differently to me than before, from her actions and body language. Last time she saw me she couldn't stop talking to me and gave me a big hug bye. Now whenever she looks at me it's uneasy, and when I try to position myself to get close in case she want a hug she distances. I immediately congratulated her after the game on her performance and she ignored it twice, citing how horrible it was. I don't know what my girlfriend told her.\n\nI had politely and gently asked her three times to stop bringing our problems to her friends, stop sending them texts and weaponizing them against me. I told her if she continued to do this we would be in a negative feedback loop until her friends all hate me since she feeds them every one of our problems, painting me in a bad light without my side of the story, and using that as the main catalyst to end the relationship. Instead she could formulate her own opinions, place them against more neutral or blunt third-parties, and then think it out, instead of airing our dirty laundry to her entire inner circle constantly. I advised that if something is so major she feels it will end the relationship she can share it with her inner circle, but any ranting or venting should go to randoms I will never meet, not the people I'm expected to hang out with all the time. She refused.\n\nI also confessed to her that the only things I would change about the relationship are cutting R out of her life and stopping going to friends over small things. I told her I did wish she'd move in and split rent ASAP and we could work towards having a kid, but that I'd wait to not be selfish because I know she has her own goals.\n\nShe had a habit of telling me I'm crazy and that I need therapy when she's upset with me. When I finally went to therapy my therapist agreed with all of my \"crazy\" takes and told me I'm not the problem, she is. She has 30 years of experience with couple's counseling. Her therapist has no experience with couple's counseling and is mainly a nutritionist.\n\nI wake up to this text 8 months in: \"I would like to take a break from our relationship this weekend. I need time to re evaluate and think about out what\u2019s been going on with us. I would like some time till at least Tuesday to talk to my therapist about this. She has been on vacation and not available to talk to. Please do not come to my game tonight, or the bbq on Saturday. I can\u2019t stop you from going to pickup on Sunday but if you are going please let me know and I will skip it. I don\u2019t not want to talk and go back and forth about this. This is my decision I\u2019ve given a lot of thought to and I\u2019m not going to change my mind. Please respect my wishes.\"\n\nI give her her space. I send her Wednesday at 5 PM \"it's past tuesday what's the news\", she asks to give her a couple minute so she can get off work and she's going to FaceTime. She FaceTimes me in her car and says she made up her mind this weekend but procrastinated to share until today. She reads me off a speech clearly written by her friends about how we're not compatible and need to split ways and both work on ourselves, I call her out for it being written by her friends just like the text she sent me and she says it is but it's her decision. I tell her that we can continue the relationship, I just won't critique her or complain, the only reason I did that was because I wanted us both to be as comfortable as possible for the long-haul, even though we may have seen things differently since she said on our first date she has commitment issues and she's only looking for a few years, I thought I could change her mind. She says that's toxic and not being honest and we're both hurting ourselves by staying in the relationship, that I'm logical about everything and she's emotional about everything, that we tried for 8 months but it's just not working and I've hurt her feelings so bad with the joke situation and my outburst that she wants to end the relationship. She says she shared my side of the story, including parts of what I've wrote here, and everything with R, E, A, a guy named G who was my best friend since I moved here but I knew through her (she's known him a year longer), and her therapist. She says all but G said I'm emotionally abusive. Am I? G simply says that he sides with her and leaves the group chat on WhatsApp. I ask what everyone thought of the shepherd's pie situation (excluding G). She said that they all said I was being controlling, manipulative, and overstepping her boundaries, and her emotional response was valid because I was being too pushy. She says she was wrong about the college argument. She says that everyone said it's normal and healthy to bring problems to friends. I tried my best to explain to her that she weaponizes their opinions against me, that she made all the holes that sunk the ship by choosing R over me and weaponizing her friend's opinions against me and then asking me to hang out with them, she said nothing. I asked what they thought of the emotional cheating situation and no one mentioned anything about it. I said that tells me all I need to know, you're surrounded by yes men and enablers. I give her this advice: 1. don't highball and say you have sex every two weeks ideally, say you have sex once a month which is what I calculated, and be honest about not enjoying sex whatsoever and being anorgasmic as quick as makes sense to her next man, 2. I told her what I told you about the toxic cycle of weaponizing her friends against her boyfriend over every disagreement, that she needs a doormat or yes man, not someone that respects themselves, 3. not to cheat, and 4. to wait until she's figured out the rest of her life including whether she wants to move for college before hitting the dating scene because it looked like all she cared about to me was soccer and friends. She told me that she doesn't think there's anything wrong with me, that I have a good heart, just that we're toxic together, and I agreed somewhat. I told her I won't block her unless I see a guy on one of her social media stories or posts, that it would really fuck me up if she posted a guy to her Instagram because she only ever posted me to stories not a concrete post, but that I'll never block her phone number so we can communicate with each other in the future, that I won't blow up her phone number wanting her to take me back and shit, that I've already agreed and just want an open route of communication, she didn't say anything. I told her to come pick up all her stuff this weekend and she agreed. I told her \"I love you cheese girl\" and ended it with \"guess what\" and then hanging up, our inside joke.\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts, blunt or not, on this situation I would love to hear them. Thank you for reading.",

I\u2019m kind of on the fence about what to do with myself. I wanted a family, love the whole but. Well I\u2019m a 50 yr old gay black woman so it looks pretty bleak for me. I\u2019m tired of trying for a happier life as I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s possible. I try kind if lazily now bc I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible. I cannot imagine being happy and alone. I\u2019m very lonely now & this makes my life miserable. Im not religious bc I don\u2019t believe any of it but consider trying anyway bc I really need something. Anything, really. I\u2019m thinking of going back home and moving in with my mom and sister so not to live alone anymore thinking that could be helpful but that\u2019s not a life I pictured myself living either. I\u2019d be leaving the security I have where I am out if loneliness and moving away was the biggest accomplishment I have made in my life. Anyone else here and have no clue why people live without a family or a great life? What gives people the will to keep going if they don\u2019t truly enjoy having the love of others  like a spouse or kids? Like, people really value just being here. Meanwhile I\u2019m trying to figure out how I could possibly live out my days here without love and belonging. Anyone? It\u2019d be nice just to hear from other people who are in the same place or have figured it out. Thx",

        "selftext": "I (20M) spent the past 3 years in crippling depression. Basically fucked my last year of highschool because of it despite previously being a high achieving student. During the 3 years I ended up getting diagnosed with autism and adhd, and have tried lots of treatments for the depression like tms, ssri, snri, lithium, therapy. im currently on an snri and lithium, and have ghosted my therapist. I am alexithymic and therapy has been difficult for me to the point where I dont think its been helpful for me. Most of the time, I spend the sessions in awkward silence, or just going over mundane things like trying to rate my emotions from a scale of 1 to 10. \n\nThroughout my depression, I had been struggling with the desire to actually get better. When I was more depressed, I would often want to let myself get worse until I was suicidal enough to actually go ahead with the plan. I have been in and out of mental hospitals over the past 3 years for suicidal behaviour and unsuccessful attempts. In between these admissions, I\u2019d literally just spend my time in bed, neglecting hygiene, and hardly getting up.  I have tried several times to go back to study through pathway college programs. But each time, I\u2019ve struggled with focus and could never manage to get my footing. It was strange and disappointing because it used to come so easily to me in the past. \n\nBut my motivation for study had significantly weakened. Previously, I associated my grades with my sense of value and had this sense of life or death. My parents wanted me to go to medical school and I had internalised that to a very unhealthy degree, where I saw it as my sole life purpose. So when my depression hit and I fucking up my grades, I spiralled into suicidal ideation, perceiving it better to die than fail in my one purpose. \n\nOf course, since then, I\u2019ve untangled myself from that, but since I no longer have an impending threat of doom, I struggle to maintain focus or even desire for study, let alone anything. I\u2019ve gained an interest in philosophy which I hope I can study in uni, but I am afraid it\u2019ll be in vain and I\u2019ll succumb to depressive habits again. \n\nSo, I stopped going to the pathway program (I failed the last semester) and have currently spent my time lying in bed in my parents home. I\u2019m ashamed to admit that dwelling in this depressive state has become familiar and comfortable to me. I\u2019m no longer as suicidal as I used to be, nor is my depression as severe thanks to the medication. But, I still struggle to escape from this inertia, and frankly, I have very little motivation to even want to escape. ",

        "selftext": "I want to know about what steps to take in my case, how long the process might take, what are the possible legal consequences for the defendant, what might be used against me, and if it is safe to use my story to raise awareness online using. I am not disclosing any personal details but I am talking about one person. I can say this happened in a major city in PA but I\u2019m not going to disclose which one publicly. \n\nI am no longer in this situation. They do know where I currently live though because they have visited the place I am currently am at a few times. I haven\u2019t put together the exact order things happened or the date range it happened but everything happened within the last 11 months. Some of these things might not seem like much compared to everything else but it might prove a pattern. \n\nI thought the relationship was worth fighting for because of the small amount of times things were good. I didn\u2019t leave right away because of their threats to my life. I also didn\u2019t realize I was necessarily being abused until I was out and I started talking about everything they did to me. I was miserable while I was with them in a relationship. \n\nThis is what happened:\n- They injured me during intimacy one time and I had an open wound. Later, they yelled and screamed at me to get into a scolding hot bath. It was so hot that my feet started turning pink the moment I put my feet into the bath water. After I gave in and sat down in the bath water, they told me they had put bleach in the bath water too. I started crying wanting to get out so my PH doesn\u2019t get messed up. They yelled and screamed at me to get in. It progressively got so bad that I could barely walk to the ER because it hurt so much to even walk. I looked like I was walking how an elderly person \u201cshuffles\u201d or sometime like that. I was petrified with how they were acting. The er doctor told me it looked like a badly scraped knee and it was extremely irritated. The triage nurse was worried of chemical burns. When I told them this, they yelled at me for trusting the doctor over them and I should trust their home remedies they learned from their aunt or someone. \n- They threatened to come home from their job, making them lose their job, just to come home and \u201ccrash out\u201d on me and yell and scream at me. They usually mean beat people up when they say crash out. They threatened me multiple times.\n- They threatened to beat up and later murder the friends who tried to warn me of their red flags.\n- I heard from my friends, that they admitted to having a firearm they called their lawyer. They told me that they couldn\u2019t own a firearm because they are trigger happy and would end up shooting everyone except for me. I was so afraid when they said they would shoot people. Although, they also threatened me with a murder suicide if we didn\u2019t work out and or if I left them. I was scared because I knew they were capable of it.\n- I have scars under my breast because they popped my pimples even when I told them to stop, even when the were only bleeding, and even when I was I kinda screamed for moments. \n- When they were yelling at me one time, they got so mad that they slammed their phone to the ground right in front of me about a foot away from me. I was so afraid and I think they wanted to get physical with me that time. Their phone screen was shattered and it wasn\u2019t a delicate phone screen. They used to brag about how durable their phone was. I have a picture of their shattered phone screen.\n- I had to stand in the doorway to stop them from going out and murdering their elderly client at their old job. This client had accused them of threatening their life and they temporarily lost their job because of it. \n- They recorded me during intimacy without my consent twice and sent me both videos because they thought I would like it. I told them both times that I do not like being recorded without my consent. The first time they did it, their excuse was they wanted to prank me by anonymously emailing me the video just to see how I would react. They wanted to see how I would react if someone tried to blackmail me with that video.\n- They convinced me it was safe to have sex with someone who had HIV as long as the person used protection and I had a prep pill before and after intercourse. I wouldn\u2019t have done it if I realized the risks. \n- They never used protection, even when I asked, they would try to tell me why they really didn\u2019t want to. I had so many pregnancy scares. They told me that if I ever got pregnant, that I would have to tell them and they would\u2019ve never wanted me to get an abortion even if we could not afford a child. They also said that if we did have kids, that they wouldn\u2019t hit them, but they would tap them. This was their was of saying that they would hit them but not as bad as they was hit. \n- Many times when we argued they would threaten to leave me as a manipulation tactic to not make them feel bad about triggering me. They triggered me when they yelled at me because of past trauma. Looking back, I wish they would left me but I\u2019m pretty sure most of the time, they were empty threats.\n- They had me take out a credit card because they was financially irresponsible. I was so afraid of them that I got this card so they wouldn\u2019t blow up on me for not doing it. They also sometimes took my card without asking me or spent more than they told me they would. I didn\u2019t really have a choice either way. When we didn\u2019t have the money to eat and we would ask people for money, they would spend it all on unnecessary things. Whenever they asked others for money for their meds or mood stabilizers, it never spent on that. They spent last least a few grand on unnecessary things during our 10 months of being together. They had me ask my dad for $3000 because they was so bad with how they chose to spend our money that we would never have enough money for rent. Luckily, $2000 was forgiven for my graduation present. The electric was in my name and we still have $500 in debt to them. Oh, and because we couldn\u2019t pay the rent, we got evicted and now owe them over $3000. I\u2019m just glad that the lease was in both of our names. \n- They used to yell at me to stop crying and whenever I looked sad, they told me to fix my face. They would yell at me until I started crying and then got mad at me for my reaction. They told me my crying was like a 12 year old having at temper tantrum. They told me my crying was unintentional manipulation.\n- I was always walking on eggshells not knowing what would set them off and make them start yelling or screaming at me so much that it got to the point that I didn\u2019t know what decisions to make or what to say. I never knew what would make her mad next. I lost my autonomy and it got to the point where they made me feel like nobody else could put up with me and that I couldn\u2019t even take care of myself. \n- I had to start going on the bus without paying the bus fare because they were so bad with money. I also had to stop taking my meds for over 3 months because I couldn\u2019t afford them with how they were spending our money. They pretty much decided where our money went. I couldn\u2019t afford to see my therapist or psychiatrist because it wasn\u2019t budgeted so I got discharged from seeing anyone for my mental health. It was more than just an insurance issue. If we budgeted it, it was possible to keep seeing them both. \n- They put their used sex toys in the bag of stuff. It was not washed. I think they did it to mess with me. It was really gross and smelled bad. \n\nWhat evidence I have and other things that might support my case:\n- Bleach incident: Medical records, text messages, and paper trail from when I asked AI for advice on the situation.\n- Threats: I have evidence of them talking about beating people up (including two of my friends), a stranger, and me (they implied that she wanted to hurt me).\n- Wanting to murder elderly client: The client had accused them of threatening their life and I know their name and the employer so I can reach them. I have proof that they had homicidal ideation when they texted a group chat about wanting to murder this person who she fought.\n- I have the non consensual recording in my phone.\n- My friends have text messages in a group chat where they claimed to own a firearm that they named their lawyer.\n- I have a photo of their broken phone screen.\n- I have active debt and I never had any issues with money management before this. I never missed a bill or had my account overdrafted.\n- I have text messages of them being angry and telling me to stop pouting, crying, looking sad, etc. I also have text messages explaining my feelings.\n- I have a witness willing to testify who experience more severe SA, was coerced into asking others for money, and was forced to break and enter by them. \n- I have a witness that was also recorded without their consent.\n- They have an active and pending felony fraud charge. Because of this, they have talked about fleeing if they ever got caught by law enforcement. They are a flight risk and it is likely they will retaliate against anything I do.\n- I just received evidence today that they may have been on meth right before we broke up. I have other evidence of illegal activities not much related to what they did to me personally.",

For the past couple of years I've been dealing with decline in health as a very young adult. It has been so tough on me that I even stopped seeking answers because my chronic problems haven't been pin pointed to any specific reason at the moment. However recently I couldn't stand the feeling of hopelessness and now actively seeking answers, going to doctors. But despite this, I am so emotionally drained, anxiety has been making me feel awful. I've done some research into my symptoms and etc. and I might've an answer soon based on narrowing of possibilities and specialists I've seen, but the fact that something is wrong with my body and that I probably will never be the healthy person I was once is killing me. It's really difficult not to think about death as well, it's like constant theme of my thoughts that I've. On a better note I'll be finally seeing psychiatrist first time in my life, however it hasn't brought me any relief. I just can't stop worrying that things just will get worse eventually. I just want some closure, especially from young people like me who have to deal with this. ",

        "selftext": "Location: U.S.\n\n\nLong story, bear with me. Back in October, I (25f) went on a date with a girl(30f), we\u2019ll call her Lanee. Date went great, but the following day I got an email to my employer email about how awful the girl I went out with is. It was a long and really hard to understand email. Basically, one of her exes (we\u2019ll call her Maggie, 34f) made a fake persona and emailed me as that. There was quite a bit of back and forth, but whatever. \n\nThis girl became a mess for us. For months, she would reach out and not leave us alone. She did things like \n- fake court documents about restraining orders on her \u201ccousin\u201d (her fake persona)\n- Fabricated a dating profile for me and screenshots, sent to the girl I\u2019m seeing to make me look like a cheater \n- Made up stories about how she was sexually assaulted by an fbi agent \n- Used ai voice generators for a fake phone call\n- Faked her own suicide (Lanee called the police who went to her house, she was fine)\n- Told me I am crazy and should be working around kids, threatened to contact my boss (thank GOD I told my HR about this when it happened) \n-this whole situation forced me to come out to a lot of people, which I know has no legal implications but it was very hard for me. I tried very hard to keep my work and private life separate.\n\nCrazy girl lives on the other side of the country, I\u2019ve never met her and she doesn\u2019t know me. But, this is escalated back in January. At this point, both of us have her phone number blocked and any contact with her blocked. Unfortunately you can\u2019t block emails, just send them to spam. \nAnyways, some awful things start showing up on social media about me. I work for a university as a coach. There are comments about how I am a sexual predator, taking photos of my players in the locker room, just really scary awful things. All from fake accounts, brand new accounts. I immediately went to the police who told me they couldn\u2019t do anything, because they don\u2019t police the internet. Which I do kind of understand but it sucked to hear. So I spoke with my HR again who immediately knew it was the girl I told them about back in October, thankfully. Anyways, at some point the school was working with the police, and they went to her house across the country where she lives with her parents. The police must have scared the shit out of her with that visit because after that nothing else has happened. The investigator was trying to get a warrant to ping where the comments came from but it was denied, which essentially ended the whole case because there was nothing else that could be done.\nAs of right now, all of this is still out there, months later. I\u2019ve tried contacting Facebook and Instagram, tons of people have reported the comments, it doesn\u2019t matter they won\u2019t take them down. The school was forced to investigate me of course because these were serious accusations, and nothing came from it because it was as baseless. \n\nSo that\u2019s where I\u2019m at. Do I just let it go now, or do I pursuit legal action? I don\u2019t have a ton of money to just go hire a lawyer. I know that stuff can get very expensive. I have an entire document with a timeline and screenshots of everything that has happened since the first date. Also, we both tried filing no contact orders which were denied. I hope this is enough info, I\u2019ll answer any questions if it\u2019s not, thanks for reading <3\n\nEdit: location- NM ",

        "selftext": "Dear \\[Agent\\],\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\[Personalized blurb\\]\n\nAdam Lecomte has spent his whole life trying to hide his autism\u2014but it\u2019s turning him into a ghost. When his fun-loving, vivacious classmate, Cleo Marlowe, pulls him into her reckless adventures, he dares to believe he\u2019s on the verge of belonging. But after their vulnerable, windswept night on the mountainside, he learns that her impulsive outings simply mask her deep-seated fear of abandonment.\n\nThey\u2019re opposites. But when their sleepy college town is haunted by mysterious deaths, they\u2019re the only ones who seem to notice. Today, it\u2019s Diego Hernandez, a prisoner whose last words to Adam were an ominous warning: tomorrow, it could be anyone. Even Adam.\n\nAdam and his friends can\u2019t let the bodies keep piling up, but the deeper they dig, the more their secrets threaten to tear them apart. How can Cleo trust her friends to stay by her when even her parents didn\u2019t? Tommy\u2019s becoming aggressive and paranoid. And Violet\u2014well, she knows why these deaths are necessary, but she can\u2019t let her friends find out.\n\nThere\u2019s a mysterious figure behind the scenes, directing his puppets to enforce the List of names marked for death. Every day, doom strikes closer. Though Adam has distrusted his own senses ever since he can remember, he cannot wait for a hero any longer. He must abandon his role as a silent observer and become his own person\u2014before they all end up on the List.\n\nWHILE WE\u2019RE STILL HUMAN, a coming-of-age thriller complete at 88,000 words, brutally confronts what it means to come up against problems too big to beat. Combining the suspenseful critique of privilege in *They Wish They Were Us* with *Looking for Alaska\u2019s* search for meaning amid tragedy, WHILE WE\u2019RE STILL HUMAN is a story about how we can set ourselves free by standing up against suffering.\n\nAs an autistic attorney in \\[Region\\] specializing in criminal and civil rights cases, I\u2019ve witnessed firsthand the hopelessness that comes hand-in-hand with fighting for change\u2014as well as the power we reclaim by embracing our flaws. While this would be my first full-length novel, I\u2019ve previously published a variety of works, including two storytelling podcasts, a scholarly journal article, opinion pieces, and an oral history.\n\nThank you very much for your time and consideration. I would be delighted to send you the full manuscript and discuss the possibility of working together.\n\nBest regards,\n\n\\[My name\\]\n\n**FIRST 300 WORDS**\n\nThe day that Diego Hernandez predicted his own murder, the prettiest girl I knew started crying in my arms.\u00a0\n\nI wasn\u2019t prepared for either.\n\nBut is any college sophomore who\u2019s running himself ragged, burning like a sputtering candle on its last drops of wax? Begging to claim what everyone else inherited by *birthright*?\n\nEven so, you\u2019d think I would have taken more notice of the guy who said he was going to die.\n\nProblem is, anyone can say *anything*. Or nothing at all.\n\nLike Danny. My friend. Popular with girls\u2014and guys, if that\u2019s your thing. They revolved around him like the planets orbited the sun. For the same reason. Because he radiated light and life into the dullest of gatherings.\n\nBut today, he remained tight-lipped. Which I assume was, for normal people, a minor irritation. *Their loss*, they\u2019d shrug. But me? It was panic-inducing. A reminder that I walked through society without flesh\u2014an invisible ghost. My very existence tied up in the unpredictable winds of *socially acceptable*.\n\n\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d\n\nHe turned his head in my direction for half a second, but didn\u2019t make eye contact. Glanced at me, then back to his phone. Enough that I knew it was deliberate. Another friendship over, just like that.\n\nI was just a placeholder. Maybe their sounding board when things got rough. But from the day I met someone, they already had one foot out the door.\n\nI\u2019d thought he was different.\n\nSo I stared.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t have been more than a few seconds. I was too conscious of what looked\u2014and didn\u2019t look\u2014normal. By necessity. But the moments dilated into near eternity as I crumpled with the futility of processing this new loss.\n\nSomeone had put their hand on my shoulder. It wasn\u2019t welcome, but at least it was a distraction.",

Mood stabilizers, antidepressants, birth controls (Vyvanse 70mg~back to it after taking Adderall 60mh) (pristiq) and (zopiclone). the usual suspects. But there are times when I don\u2019t take them the way I\u2019m supposed to. Sometimes I skip doses. Sometimes I double them. Sometimes I stop completely. Not because I think it\u2019ll help me \u2014 but because on some level, it\u2019s self-harm. A quiet rebellion. A way to feel something or punish myself without leaving visible scars.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I\u2019ve realized: messing with my meds like that almost always pushes me into mania. Not the \u201cfun\u201d kind people romanticize. The kind that keeps me awake for days, racing thoughts, impulsive spending, emotional rollercoasters, irritability, feeling invincible\u2026 until I crash. Hard.\n\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m playing Russian roulette with my brain chemistry. And while in the moment it might feel like I have control, the aftermath proves I don\u2019t.\n\nIf anyone else has experienced this \u2014 using meds as a subtle form of self-harm \u2014 I\u2019d love to hear how you deal with it, or how you got out of the cycle. Because it\u2019s hard, and honestly, sometimes it feels shameful. But I know I\u2019m not alone.",

After I gave in and sat down in the bath water, they told me they had put bleach in the bath water too. I started crying wanting to get out so my PH doesn\u2019t get messed up. They yelled and screamed at me to get in. It progressively got so bad that I could barely walk to the ER because it hurt so much to even walk. I looked like I was walking how an elderly person \u201cshuffles\u201d or sometime like that. I was petrified with how they were acting. The er doctor told me it looked like a badly scraped knee and it was extremely irritated. The triage nurse was worried of chemical burns. When I told them this, they yelled at me for trusting the doctor over them and I should trust their home remedies they learned from their aunt or someone. \n- They threatened to come home from their job, making them lose their job, just to come home and \u201ccrash out\u201d on me and yell and scream at me. They usually mean beat people up when they say crash out. They threatened me multiple times.\n- They threatened to beat up and later murder the friends who tried to warn me of their red flags.\n- I heard from my friends, that they admitted to having a firearm they called their lawyer. They told me that they couldn\u2019t own a firearm because they are trigger happy and would end up shooting everyone except for me. I was so afraid when they said they would shoot people. Although, they also threatened me with a murder suicide if we didn\u2019t work out and or if I left them. I was scared because I knew they were capable of it.\n- I have scars under my breast because they popped my pimples even when I told them to stop, even when the were only bleeding, and even when I was I kinda screamed for moments. \n- When they were yelling at me one time, they got so mad that they slammed their phone to the ground right in front of me about a foot away from me. I was so afraid and I think they wanted to get physical with me that time. Their phone screen was shattered and it wasn\u2019t a delicate phone screen. They used to brag about how durable their phone was. I have a picture of their shattered phone screen.\n- I had to stand in the doorway to stop them from going out and murdering their elderly client at their old job. This client had accused them of threatening their life and they temporarily lost their job because of it. \n- They recorded me during intimacy without my consent twice and sent me both videos because they thought I would like it. I told them both times that I do not like being recorded without my consent. The first time they did it, their excuse was they wanted to prank me by anonymously emailing me the video just to see how I would react. They wanted to see how I would react if someone tried to blackmail me with that video.\n- They convinced me it was safe to have sex with someone who had HIV as long as the person used protection and I had a prep pill before and after intercourse. I wouldn\u2019t have done it if I realized the risks. \n- They never used protection, even when I asked, they would try to tell me why they really didn\u2019t want to. I had so many pregnancy scares. They told me that if I ever got pregnant, that I would have to tell them and they would\u2019ve never wanted me to get an abortion even if we could not afford a child. They also said that if we did have kids, that they wouldn\u2019t hit them, but they would tap them. This was their was of saying that they would hit them but not as bad as they was hit. \n- Many times when we argued they would threaten to leave me as a manipulation tactic to not make them feel bad about triggering me. They triggered me when they yelled at me because of past trauma. Looking back, I wish they would left me but I\u2019m pretty sure most of the time, they were empty threats.\n- They had me take out a credit card because they was financially irresponsible. I was so afraid of them that I got this card so they wouldn\u2019t blow up on me for not doing it. They also sometimes took my card without asking me or spent more than they told me they would. I didn\u2019t really have a choice either way. When we didn\u2019t have the money to eat and we would ask people for money, they would spend it all on unnecessary things. Whenever they asked others for money for their meds or mood stabilizers, it never spent on that. They spent last least a few grand on unnecessary things during our 10 months of being together. They had me ask my dad for $3000 because they was so bad with how they chose to spend our money that we would never have enough money for rent. Luckily, $2000 was forgiven for my graduation present. The electric was in my name and we still have $500 in debt to them. Oh, and because we couldn\u2019t pay the rent, we got evicted and now owe them over $3000. I\u2019m just glad that the lease was in both of our names. \n- They used to yell at me to stop crying and whenever I looked sad, they told me to fix my face. They would yell at me until I started crying and then got mad at me for my reaction. They told me my crying was like a 12 year old having at temper tantrum. They told me my crying was unintentional manipulation.\n- I was always walking on eggshells not knowing what would set them off and make them start yelling or screaming at me so much that it got to the point that I didn\u2019t know what decisions to make or what to say. I never knew what would make her mad next. I lost my autonomy and it got to the point where they made me feel like nobody else could put up with me and that I couldn\u2019t even take care of myself. \n- I had to start going on the bus without paying the bus fare because they were so bad with money. I also had to stop taking my meds for over 3 months because I couldn\u2019t afford them with how they were spending our money. They pretty much decided where our money went. I couldn\u2019t afford to see my therapist or psychiatrist because it wasn\u2019t budgeted so I got discharged from seeing anyone for my mental health. It was more than just an insurance issue. If we budgeted it, it was possible to keep seeing them both. \n- They put their used sex toys in the bag of stuff. It was not washed. I think they did it to mess with me. It was really gross and smelled bad. \n\nWhat evidence I have and other things that might support my case:\n- Bleach incident: Medical records, text messages, and paper trail from when I asked AI for advice on the situation.\n- Threats: I have evidence of them talking about beating people up (including two of my friends), a stranger, and me (they implied that she wanted to hurt me).\n- Wanting to murder elderly client: The client had accused them of threatening their life and I know their name and the employer so I can reach them. I have proof that they had homicidal ideation when they texted a group chat about wanting to murder this person who she fought.\n- I have the non consensual recording in my phone.\n- My friends have text messages in a group chat where they claimed to own a firearm that they named their lawyer.\n- I have a photo of their broken phone screen.\n- I have active debt and I never had any issues with money management before this. I never missed a bill or had my account overdrafted.\n- I have text messages of them being angry and telling me to stop pouting, crying, looking sad, etc. I also have text messages explaining my feelings.\n- I have a witness willing to testify who experience more severe SA, was coerced into asking others for money, and was forced to break and enter by them. \n- I have a witness that was also recorded without their consent.\n- They have an active and pending felony fraud charge. Because of this, they have talked about fleeing if they ever got caught by law enforcement. They are a flight risk and it is likely they will retaliate against anything I do.\n- I just received evidence today that they may have been on meth right before we broke up. I have other evidence of illegal activities not much related to what they did to me personally.",

        "title": "I feel horrible with a good friend getting drained in relationship but can't do anything about it.",
        "selftext": "I 27F, had went through a very difficult relationship few years ago, to an extent I still hesitate to find a new one. But I came out strong, learned my lessons from experiences, also after that phase I am quite familiar with who is wrong and who is right for us in life thing. Very few people who were there with me in that phase and one I made friends in the process. So I would always have an admiration and gratitude for them.\n\nMy friend is an extremely talented guy. He had been on top of his career ever since he joined, a guy with a lot of positive energy and very comforting to listen to. We live in different cities, not like we talk everyday or totally emotionally dependent on each other but when we do we often talk about how we have crossed the phase of maintaining a friendship with norms.\n\n1.5 years ago, he told me he met a new jr at work. I teased him he said he isn't interested but she seems good girl. So eventually he probably needed an easy escape he said his jr is interested in him.(He was actually  trying to get out of an one sided love at that time with someone else at that time) so may be it was easy escape for him so he casually started going out with the jr. Eventually became part of her circle too. Till then of course I was happy looking at my friend finally moving ahead in life. Whenever we talked I asked him how is it going! He kept saying he isn't sure. They are taking things casually she is a nice girl but they want different things from life. Knowing how he described her even I understood this is not something meant to last forever. \n\nBut since last one year, the girl wanted commitment which is fair enough. He wasn't ready for it but she kind of gave him hard times in his office circle like he is toxic. After 2 3 months he too gave a nod as it would be wrong to left a girl played around if she was that serious. Things started going downhill in his life ever since then. We understood this is where he lost the grip, he tried hard to convince himself ready for a relationship. To take the matter ahead they started living together.\n\nThings started going downhill ever since that. He lost connection with his family, with his friends, his social circle and importantly he has become extremely lazy to his work demands. Everyone in our limited circle talks about him changing himself to adjust with her norms. It should be cute but it's not. Even though I too had a hint but which is fine, if he found peace in love. \n\nBut then they broke up again 6 months ago. After the first break up he told me he wasn't happy at all. She is nice girl but they totally have different lifestyles. She is more of a girl who loves party social media, she wants that attention from her boyfriend. But he had been old school lover, taking your time relationship, understanding each other's better before going public. All I understood from she isn't ambitious at all, but he is. But she wants to be part of it, not in a very positive way. It's like she wants to be referred over someone deserving because of course partners do that  for each other. \n\nHe kind of was depressed about his whole life being on social media, he changed his company so that they can now have at least a gap at workplace to make things work better. But yet he wasn't happy inside so when he cut his ties he was happy energetic person all over again. Got back in touch with his family. She wanted to be his plus one officially in his new office circle. He even gave a chance at everything but it didn't work.\n\nBut then Idk may be living alone makes you take decisions, or once you are with a person for long you become addicted they again got back together 2 months ago. This time he didn't let any of us know. We were shocked to know through social media. He completely has cut his ties off with the friends and family again. She has toned down her social media but only to the friends living him with she is doing it because she wants to convince him how she understands him, the day he again gave her public commitment she will get back to herself again to show off she has won him. No girl would have stayed with an unsure man for that long who isn't ready for her even if I call my friend a toxic man here. And this is 100% happening as it has become an ego war between her and his family-friends. \n\nNow I anyways don't talk to hom often so I have nothing to comment on it but the friends who live with him in the same city often discusses how drained  he has become. I speak to his parents though, his mother has requested me to make him understand what's going wrong with it. Hos family is getting restless about his sudden change because they have already lost their elder son. As per them they don't want to control his life but as parents they can see what's going wrong. Him changing himself better for someone will never make him feel so hopeless but it's his self destructive attitude that's killing them. I just said I can't be part of it as it's not right. Other friends who did has given up already. \n\nAs a friend, I am worried for my friend who was there for me at my most difficult phase in life. I wish nothing but happiness for him if this one works out. But my friend didn't deserve to be drained in love. He extremely tries hard to be fit into her lifestyle but then he ends up feeling isolated because he loses his. \n\nAs a woman, I am feeling horrible for being too invested their relationship to an extent of getting it off my chest on reddit. Also I don't want to be too judgemental about the girl because I never met her personally.\n\nAgain, With purely human instinct I know the other friends are not wrong, this is kind of toxic and he cannot understand how to get out of it as it is very difficult to accept being in a toxic relationship than leaving one. \n\nOverall kind of mixed emotions I am going through, it's a very strong negative instinct. one point I can clearly see losing a friend forever, or losing his core forever he was meant for bigger things, another point being a female best friend I have to careful with my boundaries, being too intrusive can be taken wrong way, I have my career too. May be one day we are proven wrong he actually found his way out with her or may be he realized it before it is too late. \n\nWhatever it is I never thought it would feel this heavy and complicated. I am honestly very sad whenever I see his family. I really want to get it off my chest and give up on any negative thought now, Idk how to too. Everyone is so over exposed to each other's lives now by different means!",

        "selftext": "Problem:  \nI have had this goal since 2013\u2014something I've always dreamed of. But I set it aside for more important things like a house and land because property prices increase every year (I don\u2019t want to live with extended family). From 2013 until now, I\u2019ve been feeling hopeless about when I\u2019ll actually achieve this goal.\n\nContext:  \nI'm 35 years old, married for six years, and we have one child. I love them, but I feel exhausted. I\u2019m the breadwinner and have provided everything I can to make them comfortable.\n\nBefore our child was born, my wife resigned from her job due to workplace power-tripping and to focus on our child. She asked me for capital to start a small online business, but the products ended up sitting unused. Then she asked for an oven, baking equipment, and paid online lessons because she wanted to learn how to bake and sell goods. She learned how to bake but never actively sold anything.\n\nWhenever I express my frustrations, she tries to look for an income source for a few days, but nothing comes out of it. It\u2019s frustrating because she always starts something but never follows through. I supported her in becoming self-employed, but then she considers doing something else. We\u2019ve argued about this multiple times, but the issue just fades away over time, which is getting tiring.\n\nIt\u2019s tough because I feel like I\u2019m handling the finances alone. Sometimes, I just want to cry. I manage to save about 20% percent of my net income every payday (not sure if that\u2019s enough for a family setup), but I know I shouldn\u2019t touch it. (I feel like I\u2019m getting depressed.) Before I can make big purchases, new expenses always come up\u2014bills, necessities, and other financial obligations\u2014so I end up saving just enough, but not enough to pursue my goal.\n\nIt\u2019s always grocery, utility bills, monthly tuition\u2014not to mention big yearly expenses like initial enrollment fees, vaccines, insurance, property tax, and car registration. What will happen when we\u2019re older? If she stays like this, we\u2019ll end up with nothing.\n\nI work extremely hard, but I don\u2019t know how much more effort or how many promotions it will take to achieve financial stability. Every time I get promoted, it feels like I\u2019m starting from zero again, climbing an even steeper mountain with no guarantee of reaching the top.\n\nI\u2019m already at my breaking point, but I don\u2019t want to make any drastic decisions. Honestly, I never realized she had this trait\u2014being so passive and lacking the drive to aim higher. I always pray she finds something she truly wants to do so that we have some leeway to achieve our goals and feel alive.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of bringing up this issue that I just wrote down my thoughts in a notebook while making this post. It\u2019s hard to sleep when I feel like this. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll just leave it on my desk\u2014maybe she\u2019ll read it while I\u2019m at work. :(\n\n# Notes from my notebook:\n\n* I\u2019m frustrated.\n* Holding onto a goal for over a decade and feeling stuck is frustrating.\n* Doing my best to provide, but it\u2019s still not enough.\n* Balancing the budget while chasing the goal makes me feel like it\u2019s out of reach. (I might not even be alive by then.)\n* Working 11 hours a day\u2014how can I earn more?\n* Before I can buy something, there\u2019s always a new expense, making me feel like I\u2019m never getting ahead. It\u2019s exhausting.\n* This is a lot to carry\u2014long work hours, taking every opportunity possible, and dealing with constant frustration.\n* I want to see the same level of grit.\n* I want to see a good level of drive.\n* I don\u2019t feel like our goals are aligned.\n* I supported her path to self-employment, but now she\u2019s considering something else. (I really want to see a firm plan!)\n* I invested in those dreams only to see them shift without real progress.\n* Breaking point.\n\n# ",

Things were supposed to be better by now. \n\nAs someone who worked on a psychiatric unit for two years, I know I should probably go to the hospital.

Maybe he wouldn't have to pay for a funeral if I was just a Jane Doe found far past her demise. But then he wouldn't know what happened to me, and I think that would stress him out more. \n\nI have things to live for. My husband, my cats. The thought of dying without seeing my family again destroys me. But I can't keep living like this.

Now, you just get bombarded with helplines and stuff. \n\nI've tried going to my husband for support. But he worked on the same psychiatric unit I did for three years, and he's still burnt out on talking people down, I guess. I've told him how I'm feeling and he doesn't really say much, other than asking me not to leave him. And I don't want to. I want to be with him forever. But I can't keep living like this. \n\nIt's obsessive, almost. I come up with a plan, find a reason it won't work, and then I come up with a new one. Over and over again. I don't want him to find me. I don't want him to have to pay for anything once I'm gone. I don't want him to mourn the wife I could have been. I want to die pretty. I want to die peacefully. I don't want someone to find me. I don't want to wake up in the hospital knowing I didn't try hard enough. I didn't do enough. I couldn't commit. \n\nBut I can't keep doing this. I can't keep living if this is the kind of life I have to live.\n\nI don't know what to do. All I can think about is dying, but I don't want to put my husband through the aftermath. But I don't think I was meant to live.\n\nThis probably doesn't make sense, and I don't even know why I'm making this post. If I decide to go through with anything, I doubt a bunch of strangers on the internet would change my mind, but... I have no one else to talk to, I guess. ",

        "selftext": "I posted here several months ago about my difficulty being received into the Church. \n\n\n\n\nI am an Afghanistan veteran with PTSD and a traumatic brain injury. I only had one deployment overseas. Our job was to find roadside bombs to secure freedom of movement for maneuver forces in our area of operations. Several members of our platoon were wounded. In the following ten years, three members of the platoon have lost their lives to suicide. I underwent years of incredible spiritual desolation and misanthropy. \n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve found an incredible amount of peace in attending Mass and adoring the holy mystery of the Eucharist. I can\u2019t be in crowds, so I only make it to occasional weekday masses that I know will be sparsely attended. I spend no more than two or three weeks in one place before moving. My therapists have said this is not unusual for people like me. \n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve studied the Catechism, completed the \u201cFormed\u201d Symbolon series, and read as deeply and widely as I can, as an unintelligent layman. I\u2019ve attempted to be received into the Church by two diocesan priests, two Jesuits, and a Franciscan. Each has offered kind words, good advice, and blessings. I am thankful for the goodness and mercy of God for allowing me, a sinner, to encounter them. Unfortunately, all have essentially said that as I am unable to participate fully in the life of the Church as the USCCB proscribes through OCIA, I cannot be received. More gently put, they tend to prayerfully anticipate my ability to participate in the future. They remind me that baptism by intention is a thing, and I will not necessarily be damned if I meet my end in the interim. \n\n\n\n\nI have read Lumen Gentihm, and I am aware of the vital role and responsibilities of the laity as part of the corpus\u2014 the body of the Church. I am unworthy and only wish to recieve the Eucharist, be closer to God and have the aid of the grace conferred by the sacraments. I yearn for it, but it has been six years and I am earnestly almost disconsolate. I have been discerning joining the Orthodox, as their sacraments are valid, but I wish to be Catholic. I don\u2019t know what to do.",

        "selftext": "Problem:  \nI have had this goal since 2013\u2014something I've always dreamed of. But I set it aside for more important things like a house and land because property prices increase every year (I don\u2019t want to live with extended family). From 2013 until now, I\u2019ve been feeling hopeless about when I\u2019ll actually achieve this goal.\n\nContext:  \nI'm 35 years old, married for six years, and we have one child. I love them, but I feel exhausted. I\u2019m the breadwinner and have provided everything I can to make them comfortable.\n\nBefore our child was born, my wife resigned from her job due to workplace power-tripping and to focus on our child. She asked me for capital to start a small online business, but the products ended up sitting unused. Then she asked for an oven, baking equipment, and paid online lessons because she wanted to learn how to bake and sell goods. She learned how to bake but never actively sold anything.\n\nWhenever I express my frustrations, she tries to look for an income source for a few days, but nothing comes out of it. It\u2019s frustrating because she always starts something but never follows through. I supported her in becoming self-employed, but then she considers doing something else. We\u2019ve argued about this multiple times, but the issue just fades away over time, which is getting tiring.\n\nIt\u2019s tough because I feel like I\u2019m handling the finances alone. Sometimes, I just want to cry. I manage to save about 20% percent of my net income every payday (not sure if that\u2019s enough for a family setup), but I know I shouldn\u2019t touch it. (I feel like I\u2019m getting depressed.) Before I can make big purchases, new expenses always come up\u2014bills, necessities, and other financial obligations\u2014so I end up saving just enough, but not enough to pursue my goal.\n\nIt\u2019s always grocery, utility bills, monthly tuition\u2014not to mention big yearly expenses like initial enrollment fees, vaccines, insurance, property tax, and car registration. What will happen when we\u2019re older? If she stays like this, we\u2019ll end up with nothing.\n\nI work extremely hard, but I don\u2019t know how much more effort or how many promotions it will take to achieve financial stability. Every time I get promoted, it feels like I\u2019m starting from zero again, climbing an even steeper mountain with no guarantee of reaching the top.\n\nI\u2019m already at my breaking point, but I don\u2019t want to make any drastic decisions. Honestly, I never realized she had this trait\u2014being so passive and lacking the drive to aim higher. I always pray she finds something she truly wants to do so that we have some leeway to achieve our goals and feel alive.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of bringing up this issue that I just wrote down my thoughts in a notebook while making this post. It\u2019s hard to sleep when I feel like this. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll just leave it on my desk\u2014maybe she\u2019ll read it while I\u2019m at work. :(\n\n# Notes from my notebook:\n\n* I\u2019m frustrated.\n* Holding onto a goal for over a decade and feeling stuck is frustrating.\n* Doing my best to provide, but it\u2019s still not enough.\n* Balancing the budget while chasing the goal makes me feel like it\u2019s out of reach. (I might not even be alive by then.)\n* Working 11 hours a day\u2014how can I earn more?\n* Before I can buy something, there\u2019s always a new expense, making me feel like I\u2019m never getting ahead. It\u2019s exhausting.\n* This is a lot to carry\u2014long work hours, taking every opportunity possible, and dealing with constant frustration.\n* I want to see the same level of grit.\n* I want to see a good level of drive.\n* I don\u2019t feel like our goals are aligned.\n* I supported her path to self-employment, but now she\u2019s considering something else. (I really want to see a firm plan!)\n* I invested in those dreams only to see them shift without real progress.\n* Breaking point.\n\n# ",

I had our daughter January 4th 2024, and she was 5 weeks and 3 days early because of how stressed and depressed I was. \n\nIn the time between his death and her birth, I had the police called on me twice. Once because I ran from home with the intent to buy a firearm and end my life, and the second time because I had expressed to my brother through text that I wanted to die sooner rather than later. My water actually broke a little bit after the cops spoke to me and left my house.\n\nIt has now been almost 15 months since his passing, and I still can't hardly function. Every time my daughter reaches a milestone, I feel so much guilt for being the parent who's here. My daughter looks so much life her dad that it kills me a little each time I see her giggle and smile. He wanted so badly to be a dad, and he loved her so much before she was born. \n\nTangled was on TV a couple nights ago and I was watching it while putting my baby to sleep, and the scene where Flynn dies in Rapunzels arms made me have a complete breakdown. I don't often let myself openly cry and vent out my feelings, but watching that scene broke something in me and I cried until I was shaking and couldn't catch my breath. I felt like I was dieing.\n\nI thought I was healing. I don't feel the need to text him every single day anymore, I can talk about him with other people and make stupid jokes about him being gone as a way to cope. But it felt like any progress I've made was ripped away and I've been thrown back to point zero. \n\nSometimes I'll even get this stinging pain in my chest like my heart is physically breaking. I don't have anyone really to talk to about this, and I feel like I've become obsessed with him and showing people how heavy my grief is. I mean, I have 2 tattoos for him, I drew our family twice and I have a shrine for him in my room. Maybe I'm losing my mind. Idk but nothing feels real and I wish I'd wake up tomorrow and this all be some fucked up dream.",

Some of these things might not seem like much compared to everything else but it might prove a pattern. \n\nTo anyone who is not a legal expert, I know I wasn\u2019t that smart to stay in this relationship but for some reason, I thought the relationship was worth fighting for because of the small amount of times things were good. I also didn\u2019t leave right away because of their threats to my life. I also didn\u2019t realize I was necessarily being abused until I was out and I started talking about everything they did to me. I was miserable while I was with them in a relationship but I was ignorant to my reality. \n\nThis is what happened:\n- They injured me during intimacy one time and I had an open wound. Later, they yelled and screamed at me to get into a scolding hot bath. It was so hot that my feet started turning pink the moment I put my feet into the bath water. After I gave in and sat down in the bath water, they told me they had put bleach in the bath water too. I started crying wanting to get out so my PH doesn\u2019t get messed up. They yelled and screamed at me to get in. It progressively got so bad that I could barely walk to the ER because it hurt so much to even walk. I looked like I was walking how an elderly person \u201cshuffles\u201d or sometime like that. I was petrified with how they were acting. The er doctor told me it looked like a badly scraped knee and it was extremely irritated. The triage nurse was worried of chemical burns. When I told them this, they yelled at me for trusting the doctor over them and I should trust their home remedies they learned from their aunt or someone. \n- They threatened to come home from their job, making them lose their job, just to come home and \u201ccrash out\u201d on me and yell and scream at me. They usually mean beat people up when they say crash out. They threatened me multiple times.\n- They threatened to beat up and later murder the friends who tried to warn me of their red flags.\n- I heard from my friends, that they admitted to having a firearm they called their lawyer. They told me that they couldn\u2019t own a firearm because they are trigger happy and would end up shooting everyone except for me. I was so afraid when they said they would shoot people. Although, they also threatened me with a murder suicide if we didn\u2019t work out and or if I left them. I was scared because I knew they were capable of it.\n- I have scars under my breast because they popped my pimples even when I told them to stop, even when the were only bleeding, and even when I was I kinda screamed for moments. \n- When they were yelling at me one time, they got so mad that they slammed their phone to the ground right in front of me about a foot away from me. I was so afraid and I think they wanted to get physical with me that time. Their phone screen was shattered and it wasn\u2019t a delicate phone screen. They used to brag about how durable their phone was. I have a picture of their shattered phone screen.\n- I had to stand in the doorway to stop them from going out and murdering their elderly client at their old job. This client had accused them of threatening their life and they temporarily lost their job because of it. \n- They recorded me during intimacy without my consent twice and sent me both videos because they thought I would like it. I told them both times that I do not like being recorded without my consent. The first time they did it, their excuse was they wanted to prank me by anonymously emailing me the video just to see how I would react. They wanted to see how I would react if someone tried to blackmail me with that video.\n- They convinced me it was safe to have sex with someone who had HIV as long as the person used protection and I had a prep pill before and after intercourse. I wouldn\u2019t have done it if I realized the risks. \n- They never used protection, even when I asked, they would try to tell me why they really didn\u2019t want to. I had so many pregnancy scares. They told me that if I ever got pregnant, that I would have to tell them and they would\u2019ve never wanted me to get an abortion even if we could not afford a child. They also said that if we did have kids, that they wouldn\u2019t hit them, but they would tap them. This was their was of saying that they would hit them but not as bad as they was hit. \n- Many times when we argued they would threaten to leave me as a manipulation tactic to not make them feel bad about triggering me. They triggered me when they yelled at me because of past trauma. Looking back, I wish they would left me but I\u2019m pretty sure most of the time, they were empty threats.\n- They had me take out a credit card because they was financially irresponsible. I was so afraid of them that I got this card so they wouldn\u2019t blow up on me for not doing it. They also sometimes took my card without asking me or spent more than they told me they would. I didn\u2019t really have a choice either way. When we didn\u2019t have the money to eat and we would ask people for money, they would spend it all on unnecessary things. Whenever they asked others for money for their meds or mood stabilizers, it never spent on that. They spent last least a few grand on unnecessary things during our 10 months of being together. They had me ask my dad for $3000 because they was so bad with how they chose to spend our money that we would never have enough money for rent. Luckily, $2000 was forgiven for my graduation present. The electric was in my name and we still have $500 in debt to them. Oh, and because we couldn\u2019t pay the rent, we got evicted and now owe them over $3000. I\u2019m just glad that the lease was in both of our names. \n- They used to yell at me to stop crying and whenever I looked sad, they told me to fix my face. They would yell at me until I started crying and then got mad at me for my reaction. They told me my crying was like a 12 year old having at temper tantrum. They told me my crying was unintentional manipulation.\n- I was always walking on eggshells not knowing what would set them off and make them start yelling or screaming at me so much that it got to the point that I didn\u2019t know what decisions to make or what to say. I never knew what would make her mad next. I lost my autonomy and it got to the point where they made me feel like nobody else could put up with me and that I couldn\u2019t even take care of myself. \n- I had to start going on the bus without paying the bus fare because they were so bad with money. I also had to stop taking my meds for over 3 months because I couldn\u2019t afford them with how they were spending our money. They pretty much decided where our money went. I couldn\u2019t afford to see my therapist or psychiatrist because it wasn\u2019t budgeted so I got discharged from seeing anyone for my mental health. It was more than just an insurance issue. If we budgeted it, it was possible to keep seeing them both. \n- They put their used sex toys in the bag of stuff. It was not washed. I think they did it to mess with me. It was really gross and smelled bad. Also, for some weird reason, they still have my pictures on their social media.\n\nWhat evidence I have and other things that might support my case:\n- Bleach incident: Medical records, text messages, and paper trail from when I asked AI for advice on the situation.\n- Threats: I have evidence of them talking about beating people up (including two of my friends), a stranger, and me (they implied that she wanted to hurt me).\n- Wanting to murder elderly client: The client had accused them of threatening their life and I know their name and the employer so I can reach them. I have proof that they had homicidal ideation when they texted a group chat about wanting to murder this person who she fought.\n- I have the non consensual recording in my phone.\n- My friends have text messages in a group chat where they claimed to own a firearm that they named their lawyer.\n- I have a photo of their broken phone screen.\n- I have active debt and I never had any issues with money management before this. I never missed a bill or had my account overdrafted.\n- I have text messages of them being angry and telling me to stop pouting, crying, looking sad, etc. I also have text messages explaining my feelings.\n- I have a witness willing to testify who experience more severe SA, was coerced into asking others for money, and was forced to break and enter by them. \n- I have a witness that was also recorded without their consent.\n- I have people willing to be witnesses because they personally saw how her anger issues are.\n- They have an active and pending felony fraud charge. Because of this, they have talked about fleeing if they ever got caught by law enforcement. They are a flight risk and it is likely they will retaliate against anything I do.\n- I just received evidence today that they may had been on meth right before we broke up. I have other evidence of illegal activities not much related to what they did to me personally. My one friend who knew people who used to be on meth, thinks they were on meth the entire relationship or at least at times. ",

        "selftext": "So long story short I have had so much testing I don't even know where to start but my feet are a mess. This all happened after a car wreck. It started in the left foot but now both are just constantly in pain. I have this deep deep cold feeling that just has been getting worse, putting me in tears. I have gone to pain management and gabapentin just makes me sleep but yet I still feel everything. \nI see two ortho's one for the spine and one for extremities. \n\nHere is where I have been sick to my stomach all day and maybe I am just over reacting. But keep in mind both orthopedics are in the same office. \nDue to a major flare-I couldn't make my ortho spine appt and had to post pone it. That moved appt is now tomorrow. \nWhen I called to cancel my appt I told the receptionist, I was having a foot flare and couldn't really bear weight. Couldn't put a sock on etc. \nthe PA called me and said a herniated disc doesn't cause crps - you need more testing. I proceeded to say so you don't think I have it? She said you need testing. I said well DR __ said I have it ( the other ortho in the office) as well as the pain management doctor YOUR office reffered me too. She then proceeds to ask if it's workers comp, (I say no.) She then said well I've never seen you as a patient ( correct?) then proceeds to tell me to go to the hospital and get a doplar of my leg? I just say I've already been to my primary... then she said a bunch of other things I don't remember because I was starting to get worked up. At the end of the call she atleast said I hope you get relief. \n\nBut how do I go tomorrow? Do I only talk about the back pain? Do I not bring up the feet pain. Maybe I'm just over thinking everything. But right now my feet have no visible discoloration only the cold temp. My thermometer won't even register a temp on them right now, but maybe I just need words of encouragement. I just so nervous that she's going to lash out again. \n\nAlso on a side note I am getting my ankle looked at for X-rays because since going to PT it is flaring up badly.\nMy PT said to ask for an MRI from the ortho but I have to see him for a consult now on the ankle and get an xray before the appt. \nI am just so tired. I am falling a sleep from exhausted because I'm not sleeping at night due to the pain being crippling. I am having thoughts of suicide but would never act on them. The only thing that gives relief is super hot baths or a heating bad but that barely takes the edge off. \n\nWhat scares me is that sometimes it feels like it's creeping up in my leg to behind my knee now. It's not all the time but I don't know who to turn too. What to even ask anymore. If anyone had advice for tomorrow I would appreciate it. I'm not one who likes any type of push back or confrontation. I like to think I'm a level headed person WHO rarely went to the doc prior to this car accident. I'm righting this in tears right now because the pain is intense, I'm scared and I'm also tired. \n\nThank you everyone for help this far. \n",

        "selftext": "I (40sF) have always tried to be a good person. Taking care of others before myself, don't bather others with my problems, etc. By 30 I had overcome a bad 1st marriage, took care of my son, remarried a wonderful man and added another child as well as completed school for my chosen career. However, my mild depression/anxiety began to take over. I ended up really struggling for awhile and then had some physical health issues contribute to the problems. I slipped into overmedicating and trying to white knuckle life, assuming it would get better. It didn't. I left my dream career and tried to pull it together. I managed for a few years and then had another health issue come up and it lead to overmedicating again and ended up with a Legal issue. While trying to just survive and fight daily against suicidal ideation due to a condition that required a risky surgery, I couldn't handle the fight required to overcome this. The financial and mental toll it was going to take to fight this false accusation by a doctor I met only twice, eventhough my primary doc fought for me, was just too much. I ended up taking a misdemeanor plea to make it go away as I had to go ahead with a risky surgery. I had a major complications after the surgery and ended up fighting to get better for several years. \n\nI am finally feeling better after really focusing on getting better with the right doctors, meds and counseling. The last year and a half I have felt better than I have my whole adult life. And I want to get back to working, helping people and generally living rather than hiding from the embarrassment of my mistakes, which is what I have been doing for over 7 years. \n\nMy question is how do I face the questions that will undoubtedly come up because of my background? I always look for the best in people, I like helping people who need it and I am very non judgemental. But I am still embarrassed by my mistakes and in a small town, I will always run into people who only know the gossip version of those issues. It is very hard for me to face that. My counselor told me once that it is kind of crazy to think that people from 7+ years ago are still thinking about me, lol. Which I get her point. I am stuck on those issues and maybe everyone else has moved on. But what do I say to possible new employers? Do I go ahead and mention that I have had some struggles in the past but have been fortunate enough to overcome them and hope they don't judge me too harshly or do I just wait and see if they bring it up? I tend to over explain so I try to just answer what is asked but I know that, based on the rest of my history, these issues will come as a surprise. I still feel ashamed and embarrassed. If the tables were turned I would easily give someone the benefit of the doubt, give credit for overcoming hard times etc. How do I get to a place where I allow that same grace for myself? ",

Amen.\n\n**Readings:**\n\n**Psalm 83Romans 5:12\u201321**\n\n**Gospel: John 8:21\u201332**\n\n21 Then said Jesus again unto them,I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.\n\n22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.\n\n23 And he said unto them,Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.\n\n24I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.\n\n25 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them,Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.\n\n26I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.\n\n27 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.\n\n28 Then said Jesus unto them,When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.\n\n29And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.\n\n30 As he spake these words, many believed on him.\n\n31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him,If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;\n\n32And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\n\n***Commentary*****:**\n\nChapter Eight begins with John\u2019s telling of the confrontation between Jesus and the Pharisees who had brought a woman before accused of adultery. His antagonists had plotted and thought they had Jesus trapped in such a way that he could not escape them, but he turned the tables on them and they had themselves had been caught in their own trap.\n\nJesus begins a general rebuke of his attackers with the \u201cI Am The Light Of The World\u201d discourse, (John 8:12-21) and he continues his rebuke of the Pharisees in the verses we examine today.\n\n\u201c***Then said Jesus again unto them,I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.***\u201d(v. 21-22)\n\nHere we see Johns testimony of the obstinate attitude of the Pharisees. Let us once again remember that in John 3:1&2, the Pharisee Nicodemus admitted that some of them realized that Jesus must be from God in light of the many miracles he had performed, acts that no mortal could possibly commit.\n\nBut even though they must have had some degree of discussion exploring the possibility that Jesus was at least sent by God, here, they ignore that part of his statement wherein he will depart and they will seek him but yet will die in their sins.\n\nI have no doubt that Nicodemus and his associates who realized that Jesus was from God, would have liked to hear his explanation of why they would die in their sins; but yet their peers chose not to hear sound teaching but stooped to yet another veiled insult.\n\nAs we mentioned in yesterday\u2019s study, they used a slur regarding Jesus\u2019 paternity; \u201c***Where is thy Father***?\u201d (John 8:19) They were using one of humanities ultimate insults, the implication that a man\u2019s Mother had been so promiscuous, that even she was unsure of the identity of the man responsible for the child in her womb. Today they stoop to yet another veiled insult, the implication that Jesus is destined to hell.\n\nJewish thought, at that time (as well as that of our own culture\u2014until relatively recently) believed that the souls of those who committed suicide were destined to the lowest depths of hell.\n\n\u201c***Will he kill himself?***\u201d (v. 22) One can almost visualize, in their mind\u2019s eye, evil smirks and malicious grins on the faces of these men who wanted nothing more than for Jesus to be silenced and his threat to their social and financial security brought to an abrupt end.\n\nJesus\u2019 response is as equally biting, but in fact, was an accurate observation. Remember, being a part of God since the beginning of time he knew full well where the souls of the Pharisees were destined.\n\n\u201c***And he said unto them,Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.***\u201d(vs. 23-24) Jesus is telling that that I am not of this world, I am from heaven; while you are of this world and from hell. Further more he says to them that if they continue to refuse to believe he is who he says he is, they will die in their sins.\n\nTaking just a moment to review Jesus\u2019 words \u201c***ye shall die in your sins***\u201d lets remember our study not so long ago on the Gospel of Luke and the parable Jesus used to illustrate the importance of seeking repentance before death and not afterwards.\n\nLuke in chapter 16, verses 19-31 tells of Jesus speaking to his disciples and some Pharisees, during which he tells of an unnamed rich man and a beggar named Lazarus. When both die, the rich man goes to Hell while Lazarus goes to heaven. Suffering in torment the rich man implores Abraham to send Lazarus from his side in Heaven to warn the rich man's family from sharing his fate. Abraham replies, \"If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\"\n\nThe implication in this parable\u2014and that of Christian tradition\u2014is that anytime prior to death, one can implore God asking for forgiveness, assuming they believe in Jesus, they are sincere and contrite, they will be granted mercy through the Grace of God. Christian tradition holds that all sins can be forgiven, with the exception of the unpardonable sin, therefore, repentance and belief in Jesus and his teachings, before death, will give the sinner a pardon from internment in hell for eternity.\n\nThese Pharisees had no intention of ever repenting, and Jesus knew it. From their own mouths they uttered their own condemnation.\n\n\u201c***Then said they unto him, Who art thou?***\u201d(v. 25) This was not an innocent inquiry on their part, but yet another veiled insult, once full of contempt and willful disobedience. Among themselves they (at least some of them) had reasoned that he must be from God due to his abilities; but their ilk had a long history of assassinating those prophets\u2014emissaries from God\u2014who had tried to warn them over the years.\n\nIn Luke 11:47 and Matthew 23:31 Jesus reminds the Pharisees that their king were responsible for the murders of the Prophets. \u201c***ye are the children of them which killed the prophets***\u201d (Mt. 23:31b) and Luke writes in the book of Acts: \u201c***Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:***\u201d (Acts 2:22-23)\n\nWhen the Pharisees demanded of Jesus, \u201cJust who do you think you are?\u201d Jesus responded thusly.\n\n\u201c***And Jesus saith unto them,Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.*** \u201d(vs. 25-27)\n\nJesus has told them repeatedly who he was, that he was sent by God (the Father) which was obvious to them but yet they chose not to accept Jesus or his teachings as to embrace his vision for the Kingdom of God, would signal an end to their cult.\n\nIt has been observed by historians and theologians that the Pharisees had all the trappings of a religious cult. Along with the Sadducees, their iron-clad control over the religious life of the Hebrew people afforded them tremendous opportunity, power, and wealth. Their collusion with the Roman occupational forces\u2014who tolerated and even rewarded local religious factions who could control the people keeping them friendly to Rome\u2014even heightened this degree of control over the temple life.\n\nThe Pharisees were more than willing to risk their very souls to keep this earthly power.\n\n\u201c***Then said Jesus unto them,When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. As he spake these words, many believed on him.***\u201d(vs. 28-30)\n\nIn other parts of the bible, the phrase \u201clifted up\u201d usually means to exalt, to honor, or to praise; but here Jesus reveals that he knows they will \u201clift him up onto the cross\u201d after which they will know he was the son of God.\n\nAt the crucifixion, as Jesus gave up his human life, those in attendance witnessed an earthquake and stormy skies, among other signs, telling them that Jesus had been who he said he was. See Matthew 27:54, Mark 15:19, and Luke 23:44-49\n\nWhen the Pharisees heard Jesus speak they became more opposed to Him. Yet there were many who heard the same words and believed in Him. They believed despite the evident opposition of the religious leaders.\n\nJesus\u2019 message of His unity with the Father was so well received by some because His life was consistent with the message. Unlike the Pharisees, one could see that Jesus was close to God. The Pharisees cultivated an image of intimacy with God, but it was evident they were not actually close to God.\n\n\u201c***Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him,If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.***\u201d(vs. 31-32)\n\nThese words of Jesus are among the most poignant and deeply moving of all the things that he said. Knowing that he was the Son of God, and that the greed and avarice of the men who belonged a religious cult, led to the persecution on the cross of an innocent man, becomes a truth that will set the believer free from eternal damnation.\n\nToday we see many who condemn Christianity, claiming that the acts of Christians are in fact antithetical to the message of Christ. But by rejecting Jesus, in particular his teachings regarding the rejection of sin, one must wonder if their abhorrence of Christians is in fact rooted in their own stubbornness and unwillingness to repent of their own sins, just as the Pharisees did.\n\n**Benediction**\n\nAlmighty God, you own everything in the heavens and on the earth; please break me from the sinful habits of greed, worldliness, covetousness, and indiscipline. What your Son has done for me is much greater than any of my fleeting and temporary accomplishments. In Jesus' name.

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, first I will say I'm sorry for any grammatical errors, English is not my first language, and sorry not sorry because this will be a LONG ride, and a Little sad and full of problems in one time.\n\nAnd also, this is my first time posting on Reddit ever, but truly wanted to do it in this beatiful community <3\n\nThis maybe is going to be a little messy, 'cause I'm quite emotional lately but I'll try my best to make it coherent enough.\n\nI'll use some fake names for privacy reasons of course.\n\nI'll start giving context I (32F) have been with my BF (33M) (I'll call him \"Julius\") for almost 5 years together, we've been living together for 4. We've met when the country was still on the pandemic, but when the quarentine was less strict. For me it was love almost instantly, I was single for 4 or 5 years before I met him, so when I though I found someone that was meeting my standards I was over the moon with joy and love. At the beggining of the situationship we were I stand my ground about what I wanted, and that is that I'd always wanted to get married but I didn't wanted to have kids (I had a very traumatic childhood because of my mother so I always felt I'd be a horrible mother) I was firm about that, he said he was ok with it so we continued to know each other and after almost 6 months I said to him I loved him, he didn't answered it back right then, but a couple of days after he said it back and we started the relationship there. Everything was great and after some months we decided to live together. For this I'll give some context, it's not that any of us had a place for our own, we both lived with our mothers basically (before jumping to conclusions that is a red flag or something in our country the renting or place buying is almost something imposible, we live in Argentina, I'll just say the economy here makes really difficult for anyone to live by their own if you don't make Good money) so, he was living on a room that was on the yard of his mother's house, so the kitchen and bathroom were shared between his mom and Little brother and us, obviously that wasn't something bad at first. Another piece of context, by the time we started dating I was working cleaning a house, because the pandemic made me lose my former job (I worked as a cooking assistant on a catering) so I was almost jobless (because the paid wasn't Good enough to anything) and I was in the verge of changing carreers, before moving in with him I alredy started studying an IT carreer, so he knew how it was my job situation before asking me to move in, and he also knew, because I was clear about everything, that I was battling some mental health issues (I battled with depression and anxiety since I was 15 with 2 suicide attempts on my back, not proud but part of my story) Well, everything was nice and beautiful at first, but fastforward a year in the future, we're now at 2022, on the last day of April I lost my stepfather to a long battle of tuberculosis, he was the only father figure I had the last 15 years since my father left and run to another country, since I was alredy battling my depression without a profesional help this only made it stronger, I was devastated and didn't had the energy to even exist, to put an extra weigh I was in exam time on my college\u2026 so everything was just adding up and I was doing my best to exist and try to do the things I was supposed to do, but one thing was way out of my priority list and that was sex. Since I was with the least sexual energy and was to put it in words \"apathic\" because I was FRICKING DEPRESSED, he though I was having an affair\u2026 ok I can understand that my lack of sexual energy could give that vibe, but he didn't even try to talk with me about that or didn't even try to understand that really was my depression and not anything else, I guess you know were I'm going with this, he did in fact cheated on me... I knew it, I had the suspision that he cheated with his friend from other country that came to visit, I call it femenine intuition because I didn't had proof, so I confronted him with that and he admitted it, I was heartbroken, more when he told me his reasoning to do it \"I though you were cheating and that was why you were less sexually\" I never cheated, ever. So I texted my best friend we'll call him \"Nick\" and asked him if he and his GF we'll call her \"Melanie\" (who I dearly love because she such an angel) if they were okay if I crashed on their couch for the night cause I couldn't stand sleeping on the same bed as Julius. I went to their home and talk and cried for hours, since I was still having the pain from my stepfather passing away and now this I was so fricking messed up mentally. In the conversation Nick and Melanie asked me if I was willing to forgive the cheating or if I wanted to break up, I was deeply in love and always battled with self deprecation son self love was not a thing in my dictionary, clearly\u2026 I said I was willing to forgive but with conditions, and they said something I took really with me, they said \"Remember if you forgive you have to let go, you can't get attached to the fact he cheated because forgiving is about letting go and giving the chance to make things good again\" I think about it for some days before coming back to the place we shared, I (much to my actual regret) decided to forgive and gave the chance to fix the relationship. I'll say that I've got somehing great from this experience, this made me take a step and seek professional help and started therapy for my depression and suicidal thoughs, 2 years after psicological and psichiatric treatment I've got the help so much needed and finished my treatment (hooray for that)\n\nWell things went well for quite some time, we had Good times and not so Good time. I was studying a lot to get my career through and stopped working as for his petition, so I could focus my 100% on the study and we made a deal he'd support us with the condition that when I work on my field and make Good money I'd buy us a car, ok no big deal for me, it's something I would also like, so I agree (remember this deal), he worked but didn't make big money, so we lived through rough times, but he had a downside I wasn't expecting at first when we started living together, one is that he really really loves getting delivery food, me on the other hand likes it as a treat not as an all week meal plan, the problem with this love he had with delivery is that he used his own credit card A LOT to do this (since he was the one with the money I felt I hadn't a say on the matters of how he spends his money) months later he told me the debt he had with his credit card (if you watched How I Met Your Mother is like the scene where Marshall found the credit card debt Lily had) he had maxed it out and couldn't afford to pay it, so he took a loan on his work and paid the debt, then he asked me if I could do the finances of the house a.k.a he gave me his monthly pay and let me control it, we made it through a lot of time, but since I'm a little rat, to put it in words, and prefer to live frugal but without debt and with that I didn't mind to say no to treats and delivery and all the things he loved, almost 3 months later he decided he no longer wanted me to do the finances. That's ok by me, a thing less to worry in the mental load I already had, because I forget to mention, he's not the cleanest nor organized person I've met, so cleaning and cooking is almost something I have to worry about\u2026 \n\nAlso, I forget to mention something else that is important, remeber how I said on the beggining I dind't wanted kids and he agreed? Well, time in the relationship he admitted he did wanted kids and I quote what he said \"I resigned to the idea of being a father because of you\" so basically he guilt tripped me into rethink that (this was before the cheating) so I rethinked it and said maybe I could think more about it and I could change my mind. Yeah so, I said when we have a house on our own, a Little more of economic stability and I finished my career I would maybe say yes, but after getting married and after 35, just to have some time in case and to enjoy my professional life, since I've always been a career driven person.\n\nSo, were we left it before this pause, we were out of debt, he was managing his money again and I was studying and doing almost all the house work, oh by the way it's not like he has to go to work all the days to the office, he Works remote for all the month except 2 to 3 days that he has to go to the office, 2 to 3 days on the month, not the week, the month honey\u2026 so yes, he's home most of the time and he can do chores, but if I don't say to him exactly what it has to be done he doesn't even notice it. I guess you'll be counting red flags by the dozen right now, let me tell you I was deeply in love that I've never noticed them\n\nFast forward again, we're now on November 2023, I was on my last year of college, exam time again (the timing for the thing that happens always is so damn bad) I was preparing one last Project we had to submit for our final grade, I receive a call from my mom, she tells me she's not feeling Good, I asked a few question and noticed it was serious, I tell her to wait there and I call a friend of hers and asked to take her to the hospital, since I live an hour away I wasn't going to be as quick as her, I called an uber an went as far as I could to the hospital she took her, quite some time an some incompetent ER doctors that wanted to realese her with the blood pressure sky rocketing and just a note to see a cardiologyst, I took her in that moment to the cardiologyst and he asked why they relesed her if she was having a fricking stroke, he wrote a note (since he worked on the same hospital) and told to took her to the ER again, they took the note, check her vitals and put her in the ICU, and she was hospitalized for a week almost, again bad timing for everything, almost lost my mother, we had to move to her house for that time with our cats, what takes us to the next problema that happened in that time one of our cats because of the stress of being on an unknown place with other cats developed an urinary infection, so December 2023 my mom was Good but now my cat was sick, he had 3 catheters in the span of a month, so I was dealing with that stress, exam stress and almost losing my mother stress, on the 26 of December to add up to ALL THAT one of the cats I had went missing (sadly we never found him, still miss him), so I wasn't suprised when my period didn't came on time that month because all that stress really was something that could make me be late... but when a week passed and still no period I started worrying, so I took a pregnancy test on January 3rd, to my surprise it was positive, I was shocked, we had almost nothing of sex because everything that was going on, but maybe one time we had a slip and didn't noticed\u2026 by the moment I found out I was pregnant, the vets also told us that our cat had to go to surgery urgent, because he could die, we took the dollars I had on savings (gifted by my aunt over the years) an exchanged them to pay the cat's surgery, the cat survived they had to remove his penis completly, but he was fine and we were happy with that. So, on the pregnancy thing, we weren't having a Good economic situation so we both decided the best was not to have it (and of course I didn't wanted to have it right now cause as I said earlier I wanted my degree and a work, and also get married before) but life has bigger plans in mind and the universe Heard it, and dind't wanted me to feel horrible for going for an abortion, so the stress of the cats surgery and everything made me have a miscarriage through the span of a week (it was painful both phisically and mentally) but it was the best. 2 weeks later I've got a job and was doing great, but 3 monthslater the company I was working for decided they didn't want to renew my contract (here we have a 3 month contract probation time, so if 3 month go by the companies can fire you without cause and without indemnization) so again jobless, but still looking for a job.\n\nI promise you, this is the last bit of the long story! Our last fast forward, to November 2024, again Julius had made a big credit card debt, this time was not only stupid things he buyed, but also the monthly food, so 50/50 his lack of financial control and the country's economic russian roulette\u2026 by this time we had and argoument with his mom about the services, we payed for them, as we lived there, but her never even turn of a light so the bills were too damn high for us to pay, so he tried to talk to her about that and how we couldn't afford them so she had to help, she wouldn't hear it, so the argument scalated to her trying to kick us out, in this moment I finally found a job, the one I'm currently at, and gave me a really Good pay, so we could afford a prefabricated house to put on the back, and put services to Julius name for our home. Remember we're having a debt, so when we bought the house we we're out of the money we were going to use to pay that debt, so I had the \"amazing\" idea to take a loan with my bank to help him pay a fraction of that debt, to put it in dollar the debt was almost 2/3k, so in my country's currency that's A LOT, so yeah I went also into debt just to help him pay a fraction of that. So now, he still uses irresponsibly his credit card, so the debt never left us, and I'm also paying my loan.\n\nSo, to the question of this post, the relation is struggling since half a year, we're not having our best time, I'm pretty tired of absolutly everything, he's no longer being caring, loving or supporting as he always was, he keep saying a lot of things that hurts me and never apologize and always deflects it towards me, everytime I said \"I remember X thing being this way\" and doesn't line up what he remembers, he says I'm gaslighting him, everytime I try to open up about something it hurts me, he says I put on defensive an don't listen to him, and that I'm on the wrong\u2026\n\nSo with all this much context, and belive me I summarized a lot of what happened and what's going on, I'm feeling tired of this relationship, I'm feeling unloved and lacking romance at all, or basic comprehension\u2026 \n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot, remember how I said earlier, remeber the car thing because it's important later, well a few weeks ago, he had a Little meltdown about not having a car, and how I didn't bought it, well I kept saying we need to be better economically to buy a car, and he put an ultim\u00e1tum, he said \"If by the time I'm 40 you didn't bought a car and I have to buy it myself, we Will end this relationship\" \u2026 So yeah, he's being a Little too much with that, also as I said, I wish to get married, and being saying this to him, not hinting saying it directly, that I want him to propose and enjoy the engagement, but he always say \"We need to have a lot of money to get married because I want a big party\" (It's not like we can have a 200 guest wedding, if we have 50 people max is a lot, so no need to throw the house out of the Windows) but I reluctantly agreed\u2026 \n\nSo then, with ALL this in mind, I've been really considering to break up with him, but the only thing that makes me reconsider is the debt, I don't feel comfortable leaving him with the credit card debt by his own, but I can't take it anymore really, I spent more time sad and crying than I spent happy in this relationship. So would I be the asshole if I break up with him and leave him by his own with the credit card debt that he was stupid enough to not listen to me and not keep getting it bigger?\n\nAgain I'm so so sorry if I written a lot and put almost all the story for context, but belive me I left a lot behind to tell.\n\nThanks if you answer, and thanks to our potato queen Charlotte for giving us this safe space to ask for guidance and help. Love you Charlotte <3\n\nI Will accept my judgement even if I'm the ahole\n\nThanks for Reading, I truly needed to get this out of my chest.\n\nLove you all <3",

And Jesus saith unto them,Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.\n\n26I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.\n\n27 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.\n\n28 Then said Jesus unto them,When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.\n\n29And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.\n\n30 As he spake these words, many believed on him.\n\n31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him,If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;\n\n32And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\n\n***Commentary*****:**\n\nChapter Eight begins with John\u2019s telling of the confrontation between Jesus and the Pharisees who had brought a woman before accused of adultery. His antagonists had plotted and thought they had Jesus trapped in such a way that he could not escape them, but he turned the tables on them and they had themselves had been caught in their own trap.\n\nJesus begins a general rebuke of his attackers with the \u201cI Am The Light Of The World\u201d discourse, (John 8:12-21) and he continues his rebuke of the Pharisees in the verses we examine today.\n\n\u201c***Then said Jesus again unto them,I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.***\u201d(v. 21-22)\n\nHere we see Johns testimony of the obstinate attitude of the Pharisees. Let us once again remember that in John 3:1&2, the Pharisee Nicodemus admitted that some of them realized that Jesus must be from God in light of the many miracles he had performed, acts that no mortal could possibly commit.\n\nBut even though they must have had some degree of discussion exploring the possibility that Jesus was at least sent by God, here, they ignore that part of his statement wherein he will depart and they will seek him but yet will die in their sins.\n\nI have no doubt that Nicodemus and his associates who realized that Jesus was from God, would have liked to hear his explanation of why they would die in their sins; but yet their peers chose not to hear sound teaching but stooped to yet another veiled insult.\n\nAs we mentioned in yesterday\u2019s study, they used a slur regarding Jesus\u2019 paternity; \u201c***Where is thy Father***?\u201d (John 8:19) They were using one of humanities ultimate insults, the implication that a man\u2019s Mother had been so promiscuous, that even she was unsure of the identity of the man responsible for the child in her womb. Today they stoop to yet another veiled insult, the implication that Jesus is destined to hell.\n\nJewish thought, at that time (as well as that of our own culture\u2014until relatively recently) believed that the souls of those who committed suicide were destined to the lowest depths of hell.\n\n\u201c***Will he kill himself?***\u201d (v. 22) One can almost visualize, in their mind\u2019s eye, evil smirks and malicious grins on the faces of these men who wanted nothing more than for Jesus to be silenced and his threat to their social and financial security brought to an abrupt end.\n\nJesus\u2019 response is as equally biting, but in fact, was an accurate observation. Remember, being a part of God since the beginning of time he knew full well where the souls of the Pharisees were destined.\n\n\u201c***And he said unto them,Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.***\u201d(vs. 23-24) Jesus is telling that that I am not of this world, I am from heaven; while you are of this world and from hell. Further more he says to them that if they continue to refuse to believe he is who he says he is, they will die in their sins.\n\nTaking just a moment to review Jesus\u2019 words \u201c***ye shall die in your sins***\u201d lets remember our study not so long ago on the Gospel of Luke and the parable Jesus used to illustrate the importance of seeking repentance before death and not afterwards.\n\nLuke in chapter 16, verses 19-31 tells of Jesus speaking to his disciples and some Pharisees, during which he tells of an unnamed rich man and a beggar named Lazarus. When both die, the rich man goes to Hell while Lazarus goes to heaven. Suffering in torment the rich man implores Abraham to send Lazarus from his side in Heaven to warn the rich man's family from sharing his fate. Abraham replies, \"If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\"\n\nThe implication in this parable\u2014and that of Christian tradition\u2014is that anytime prior to death, one can implore God asking for forgiveness, assuming they believe in Jesus, they are sincere and contrite, they will be granted mercy through the Grace of God. Christian tradition holds that all sins can be forgiven, with the exception of the unpardonable sin, therefore, repentance and belief in Jesus and his teachings, before death, will give the sinner a pardon from internment in hell for eternity.\n\nThese Pharisees had no intention of ever repenting, and Jesus knew it. From their own mouths they uttered their own condemnation.\n\n\u201c***Then said they unto him, Who art thou?***\u201d(v. 25) This was not an innocent inquiry on their part, but yet another veiled insult, once full of contempt and willful disobedience. Among themselves they (at least some of them) had reasoned that he must be from God due to his abilities; but their ilk had a long history of assassinating those prophets\u2014emissaries from God\u2014who had tried to warn them over the years.\n\nIn Luke 11:47 and Matthew 23:31 Jesus reminds the Pharisees that their king were responsible for the murders of the Prophets. \u201c***ye are the children of them which killed the prophets***\u201d (Mt. 23:31b) and Luke writes in the book of Acts: \u201c***Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:***\u201d (Acts 2:22-23)\n\nWhen the Pharisees demanded of Jesus, \u201cJust who do you think you are?\u201d Jesus responded thusly.\n\n\u201c***And Jesus saith unto them,Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.*** \u201d(vs. 25-27)\n\nJesus has told them repeatedly who he was, that he was sent by God (the Father) which was obvious to them but yet they chose not to accept Jesus or his teachings as to embrace his vision for the Kingdom of God, would signal an end to their cult.\n\nIt has been observed by historians and theologians that the Pharisees had all the trappings of a religious cult. Along with the Sadducees, their iron-clad control over the religious life of the Hebrew people afforded them tremendous opportunity, power, and wealth. Their collusion with the Roman occupational forces\u2014who tolerated and even rewarded local religious factions who could control the people keeping them friendly to Rome\u2014even heightened this degree of control over the temple life.\n\nThe Pharisees were more than willing to risk their very souls to keep this earthly power.\n\n\u201c***Then said Jesus unto them,When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. As he spake these words, many believed on him.***\u201d(vs. 28-30)\n\nIn other parts of the bible, the phrase \u201clifted up\u201d usually means to exalt, to honor, or to praise; but here Jesus reveals that he knows they will \u201clift him up onto the cross\u201d after which they will know he was the son of God.\n\nAt the crucifixion, as Jesus gave up his human life, those in attendance witnessed an earthquake and stormy skies, among other signs, telling them that Jesus had been who he said he was. See Matthew 27:54, Mark 15:19, and Luke 23:44-49\n\nWhen the Pharisees heard Jesus speak they became more opposed to Him. Yet there were many who heard the same words and believed in Him. They believed despite the evident opposition of the religious leaders.\n\nJesus\u2019 message of His unity with the Father was so well received by some because His life was consistent with the message. Unlike the Pharisees, one could see that Jesus was close to God. The Pharisees cultivated an image of intimacy with God, but it was evident they were not actually close to God.\n\n\u201c***Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him,If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.***\u201d(vs. 31-32)\n\nThese words of Jesus are among the most poignant and deeply moving of all the things that he said. Knowing that he was the Son of God, and that the greed and avarice of the men who belonged a religious cult, led to the persecution on the cross of an innocent man, becomes a truth that will set the believer free from eternal damnation.\n\nToday we see many who condemn Christianity, claiming that the acts of Christians are in fact antithetical to the message of Christ. But by rejecting Jesus, in particular his teachings regarding the rejection of sin, one must wonder if their abhorrence of Christians is in fact rooted in their own stubbornness and unwillingness to repent of their own sins, just as the Pharisees did.\n\n**Benediction**\n\nAlmighty God, you own everything in the heavens and on the earth; please break me from the sinful habits of greed, worldliness, covetousness, and indiscipline. What your Son has done for me is much greater than any of my fleeting and temporary accomplishments. In Jesus' name.

Abraham replies, \"If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\"\n\nThe implication in this parable\u2014and that of Christian tradition\u2014is that anytime prior to death, one can implore God asking for forgiveness, assuming they believe in Jesus, they are sincere and contrite, they will be granted mercy through the Grace of God. Christian tradition holds that all sins can be forgiven, with the exception of the unpardonable sin, therefore, repentance and belief in Jesus and his teachings, before death, will give the sinner a pardon from internment in hell for eternity.\n\nThese Pharisees had no intention of ever repenting, and Jesus knew it. From their own mouths they uttered their own condemnation.\n\n\u201c***Then said they unto him, Who art thou?***\u201d(v. 25) This was not an innocent inquiry on their part, but yet another veiled insult, once full of contempt and willful disobedience. Among themselves they (at least some of them) had reasoned that he must be from God due to his abilities; but their ilk had a long history of assassinating those prophets\u2014emissaries from God\u2014who had tried to warn them over the years.\n\nIn Luke 11:47 and Matthew 23:31 Jesus reminds the Pharisees that their king were responsible for the murders of the Prophets. \u201c***ye are the children of them which killed the prophets***\u201d (Mt. 23:31b) and Luke writes in the book of Acts: \u201c***Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:***\u201d (Acts 2:22-23)\n\nWhen the Pharisees demanded of Jesus, \u201cJust who do you think you are?\u201d Jesus responded thusly.\n\n\u201c***And Jesus saith unto them,Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.*** \u201d(vs. 25-27)\n\nJesus has told them repeatedly who he was, that he was sent by God (the Father) which was obvious to them but yet they chose not to accept Jesus or his teachings as to embrace his vision for the Kingdom of God, would signal an end to their cult.\n\nIt has been observed by historians and theologians that the Pharisees had all the trappings of a religious cult. Along with the Sadducees, their iron-clad control over the religious life of the Hebrew people afforded them tremendous opportunity, power, and wealth. Their collusion with the Roman occupational forces\u2014who tolerated and even rewarded local religious factions who could control the people keeping them friendly to Rome\u2014even heightened this degree of control over the temple life.\n\nThe Pharisees were more than willing to risk their very souls to keep this earthly power.\n\n\u201c***Then said Jesus unto them,When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. As he spake these words, many believed on him.***\u201d(vs. 28-30)\n\nIn other parts of the bible, the phrase \u201clifted up\u201d usually means to exalt, to honor, or to praise; but here Jesus reveals that he knows they will \u201clift him up onto the cross\u201d after which they will know he was the son of God.\n\nAt the crucifixion, as Jesus gave up his human life, those in attendance witnessed an earthquake and stormy skies, among other signs, telling them that Jesus had been who he said he was. See Matthew 27:54, Mark 15:19, and Luke 23:44-49\n\nWhen the Pharisees heard Jesus speak they became more opposed to Him. Yet there were many who heard the same words and believed in Him. They believed despite the evident opposition of the religious leaders.\n\nJesus\u2019 message of His unity with the Father was so well received by some because His life was consistent with the message. Unlike the Pharisees, one could see that Jesus was close to God. The Pharisees cultivated an image of intimacy with God, but it was evident they were not actually close to God.\n\n\u201c***Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him,If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.***\u201d(vs. 31-32)\n\nThese words of Jesus are among the most poignant and deeply moving of all the things that he said. Knowing that he was the Son of God, and that the greed and avarice of the men who belonged a religious cult, led to the persecution on the cross of an innocent man, becomes a truth that will set the believer free from eternal damnation.\n\nToday we see many who condemn Christianity, claiming that the acts of Christians are in fact antithetical to the message of Christ. But by rejecting Jesus, in particular his teachings regarding the rejection of sin, one must wonder if their abhorrence of Christians is in fact rooted in their own stubbornness and unwillingness to repent of their own sins, just as the Pharisees did.\n\n**Benediction**\n\nAlmighty God, you own everything in the heavens and on the earth; please break me from the sinful habits of greed, worldliness, covetousness, and indiscipline. What your Son has done for me is much greater than any of my fleeting and temporary accomplishments. In Jesus' name.

But this week, man, im the most suicidal ive been in years. We have an expensive big safe in our house where my dad keeps all his money, all my medication, and mostly all money, drugs or important things that im not allowed to have. (Yes i havent had any money for 3 years because i only buy drugs with the money i have). Yesterday i was on the verge of committing suicide and thought \"If i manage to open the safe i can od with all my meds\" so that day i put a camera next to the safe and filmed my dad opening it so i could find out the code. At around 3am i sneaked downstairs, opened the safe and saw something way better than some meds to od, i found 500 dollars cash. I grabbed 150 and went to bed. Than as you couldve expected i went to my plug the next day and spend it all on drugs. I feel like the worst daughter in the world, if my dad finds out he will never talk to me again. Please does anyone have any tips on what to do?",

        "selftext": "My (27F) best friend (26M) and I have been close for nine years and are part of the same college friend group. He\u2019s always been supportive, protective, and aware of my mental health struggles and SA history. Our group has dark humor, but we also respect boundaries.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I was struggling mentally, so we hung out, and I opened up about how my ex dumping me via text six months ago triggered abandonment issues and unexpected hypersexuality, which brought me deep shame and self-hatred. It got so bad that I relapsed into self-harm and psychedelics. I told him how hard it was to open up about these things because of the judgment and shame. He was supportive but said I should\u2019ve spoken up sooner. I explained that I tried, but it felt like people were too preoccupied to fully listen, so I didn\u2019t want to be a burden.\n\nAs I was finally letting everything out, he suddenly called me a \u201cwhore.\u201d I got upset, but he quickly said it was a joke and hugged me. I didn\u2019t like it, especially since months ago, he had joked that I was \u201cstupid\u201d for how my ex blindsided me\u2014even though he was the one comforting me through it. I told him I was fine with jokes, just not about painful experiences. He apologized, and we moved on, getting even closer since then.\n\nLast night, though, he randomly sent me a meme about perverted women being \u201cscary\u201d and said it reminded him of me. I asked if this was about what I had opened up about, and he just said, \u201cYep, sorry if it offended you, saw it as a joke.\u201d That was my breaking point. This was the third time he disrespected my boundary despite knowing how painful these things were for me. I called him out for not taking my struggles seriously, for how it took me multiple therapy sessions just to share even a fraction of what I told him, and for breaking my trust by crossing a line he had already agreed not to. I told him I misjudged him because he proved he wasn\u2019t a safe space.\n\nHis apology:\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to start by apologizing for what I said, to be honest, I really didn\u2019t think about it too deep. I won\u2019t ask for you to change your mind, that\u2019s up to you, I won\u2019t ask you to open up any more as well if that\u2019s what makes you happy. Making fun of things is one way for me to cope with hearing heavy and heartbreaking news, I\u2019m truly sorry for offending you again. Again, I won\u2019t ask you to change your mind or thoughts at all, it seems like you\u2019ve had this on you far too long. I\u2019m sorry for taking your time.\u201d\n\nStill hurt, I told him that was exactly the problem\u2014he didn\u2019t think, even after I told him where I stood. He knowingly crossed my boundary three times and broke my trust, so I wasn\u2019t interested in his half-hearted apology. He just replied, \u201cok,\u201d and we stopped talking.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t know how to process this. We\u2019ve been through so much, and he\u2019s never disrespected my personal experiences before. I can\u2019t understand why he chose these specific things to joke about when there were a million other things he could\u2019ve said, and I would\u2019ve laughed along.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I should cut him off, especially since we share a close friend group and a trio with another friend. I also feel like I\u2019ve lost trust and the sense of comfort in our friendship. I don\u2019t know how to navigate this, and after this, I\u2019m scared to open up to anyone again.",

        "selftext": "Problem:  \nI have had this goal since 2013\u2014something I've always dreamed of. But I set it aside for more important things like a house and land because property prices increase every year (I don\u2019t want to live with extended family). From 2013 until now, I\u2019ve been feeling hopeless about when I\u2019ll actually achieve this goal.\n\nContext:  \nI'm 35 years old, married for six years, and we have one child. I love them, but I feel exhausted. I\u2019m the breadwinner and have provided everything I can to make them comfortable.\n\nBefore our child was born, my wife resigned from her job due to workplace power-tripping and to focus on our child. She asked me for capital to start a small online business, but the products ended up sitting unused. Then she asked for an oven, baking equipment, and paid online lessons because she wanted to learn how to bake and sell goods. She learned how to bake but never actively sold anything.\n\nWhenever I express my frustrations, she tries to look for an income source for a few days, but nothing comes out of it. It\u2019s frustrating because she always starts something but never follows through. I supported her in becoming self-employed, but then she considers doing something else. We\u2019ve argued about this multiple times, but the issue just fades away over time, which is getting tiring.\n\nIt\u2019s tough because I feel like I\u2019m handling the finances alone. Sometimes, I just want to cry. I manage to save about 20% percent of my net income every payday (not sure if that\u2019s enough for a family setup), but I know I shouldn\u2019t touch it. (I feel like I\u2019m getting depressed.) Before I can make big purchases, new expenses always come up\u2014bills, necessities, and other financial obligations\u2014so I end up saving just enough, but not enough to pursue my goal.\n\nIt\u2019s always grocery, utility bills, monthly tuition\u2014not to mention big yearly expenses like initial enrollment fees, vaccines, insurance, property tax, and car registration. What will happen when we\u2019re older? If she stays like this, we\u2019ll end up with nothing.\n\nI work extremely hard, but I don\u2019t know how much more effort or how many promotions it will take to achieve financial stability. Every time I get promoted, it feels like I\u2019m starting from zero again, climbing an even steeper mountain with no guarantee of reaching the top.\n\nI\u2019m already at my breaking point, but I don\u2019t want to make any drastic decisions. Honestly, I never realized she had this trait\u2014being so passive and lacking the drive to aim higher. I always pray she finds something she truly wants to do so that we have some leeway to achieve our goals and feel alive.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of bringing up this issue that I just wrote down my thoughts in a notebook while making this post. It\u2019s hard to sleep when I feel like this. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll just leave it on my desk\u2014maybe she\u2019ll read it while I\u2019m at work. :(\n\n# Notes from my notebook:\n\n* I\u2019m frustrated.\n* Holding onto a goal for over a decade and feeling stuck is frustrating.\n* Doing my best to provide, but it\u2019s still not enough.\n* Balancing the budget while chasing the goal makes me feel like it\u2019s out of reach. (I might not even be alive by then.)\n* Working 11 hours a day\u2014how can I earn more?\n* Before I can buy something, there\u2019s always a new expense, making me feel like I\u2019m never getting ahead. It\u2019s exhausting.\n* This is a lot to carry\u2014long work hours, taking every opportunity possible, and dealing with constant frustration.\n* I want to see the same level of grit.\n* I want to see a good level of drive.\n* I don\u2019t feel like our goals are aligned.\n* I supported her path to self-employment, but now she\u2019s considering something else. (I really want to see a firm plan!)\n* I invested in those dreams only to see them shift without real progress.\n* Breaking point.\n\n# ",

        "selftext": "\nProblem:  \nI have had this goal since 2013\u2014something I've always dreamed of. But I set it aside for more important things like a house and land because property prices increase every year (I don\u2019t want to live with extended family). From 2013 until now, I\u2019ve been feeling hopeless about when I\u2019ll actually achieve this goal.\n\nContext:  \nI'm 35 years old, married for six years, and we have one child. I love them, but I feel exhausted. I\u2019m the breadwinner and have provided everything I can to make them comfortable.\n\nBefore our child was born, my wife resigned from her job due to workplace power-tripping and to focus on our child. She asked me for capital to start a small online business, but the products ended up sitting unused. Then she asked for an oven, baking equipment, and paid online lessons because she wanted to learn how to bake and sell goods. She learned how to bake but never actively sold anything.\n\nWhenever I express my frustrations, she tries to look for an income source for a few days, but nothing comes out of it. It\u2019s frustrating because she always starts something but never follows through. I supported her in becoming self-employed, but then she considers doing something else. We\u2019ve argued about this multiple times, but the issue just fades away over time, which is getting tiring.\n\nIt\u2019s tough because I feel like I\u2019m handling the finances alone. Sometimes, I just want to cry. I manage to save about 20% percent of my net income every payday (not sure if that\u2019s enough for a family setup), but I know I shouldn\u2019t touch it. (I feel like I\u2019m getting depressed.) Before I can make big purchases, new expenses always come up\u2014bills, necessities, and other financial obligations\u2014so I end up saving just enough, but not enough to pursue my goal.\n\nIt\u2019s always grocery, utility bills, monthly tuition\u2014not to mention big yearly expenses like initial enrollment fees, vaccines, insurance, property tax, and car registration. What will happen when we\u2019re older? If she stays like this, we\u2019ll end up with nothing.\n\nI work extremely hard, but I don\u2019t know how much more effort or how many promotions it will take to achieve financial stability. Every time I get promoted, it feels like I\u2019m starting from zero again, climbing an even steeper mountain with no guarantee of reaching the top.\n\nI\u2019m already at my breaking point, but I don\u2019t want to make any drastic decisions. Honestly, I never realized she had this trait\u2014being so passive and lacking the drive to aim higher. I always pray she finds something she truly wants to do so that we have some leeway to achieve our goals and feel alive.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of bringing up this issue that I just wrote down my thoughts in a notebook while making this post. It\u2019s hard to sleep when I feel like this. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll just leave it on my desk\u2014maybe she\u2019ll read it while I\u2019m at work. :(\n\n# Notes from my notebook:\n\n* I\u2019m frustrated.\n* Holding onto a goal for over a decade and feeling stuck is frustrating.\n* Doing my best to provide, but it\u2019s still not enough.\n* Balancing the budget while chasing the goal makes me feel like it\u2019s out of reach. (I might not even be alive by then.)\n* Working 11 hours a day\u2014how can I earn more?\n* Before I can buy something, there\u2019s always a new expense, making me feel like I\u2019m never getting ahead. It\u2019s exhausting.\n* This is a lot to carry\u2014long work hours, taking every opportunity possible, and dealing with constant frustration.\n* I want to see the same level of grit.\n* I want to see a good level of drive.\n* I don\u2019t feel like our goals are aligned.\n* I supported her path to self-employment, but now she\u2019s considering something else. (I really want to see a firm plan!)\n* I invested in those dreams only to see them shift without real progress.\n* Breaking point.\n\n# ",

        "selftext": "today has honestly been a really rough day for me even though it's one of my days off. i buss tables 4 days a week currently at a very busy italian restaurant in a casino. i've just turned 21 and had planned to begin serving, but the stress of working at this job for i'd guess over six months has really taken a toll on me.\n\nwith a percentage of i believe sales being shared at the end of the night from servers, as well as often a smaller share from helping bar, i'm by far making the best money i've ever made, and have finally been able to properly save up a good bit of money despite car payments and such. though with my celiac, OCD, and also stealth transitioning (one week from seven months on estrogen), the constant fear for my health due to all of the gluten i'm constantly surrounded by, as well as the dysphoria that is caused by all of the constant heavy lifting leaves me constantly sad, stressed, irritable, and exhausted.\n\nbetween working out my lower body on the days i work, the 1 hour drive time in total there and back, showering, eating etc, i have no free time on days i work at all. on my days off i'm exhausted and just trying to maintain my health and errands. i work out, i try to make progress in transitioning where i can, but i find that i just feel so horrible so often. so unhappy with being alive. i haven't played games with my friends online in months, let alone talk to them much at all (i'm making efforts to return to that). i feel really behind in my progress and uncomfortable with how i look. i just feel like i've lost myself so much from all of the working. more than anything, it's been over 3 years since i've made any music, and i haven't stopped talking about how badly i want to rekindle my relationship with it. i'm about to push through making some progress for one last set of assignments before i can withdraw from school in a few days without losing the financial aid i had received. hopefully having that off of my plate will help things a little, but i don't think it is enough of a change. \n\ni began studies for an associates degree in IT about two months ago, after previously dropping out of a bachelors in computer science maybe a year or two prior, after graduating an early college program with an associates in art. my only reason for pursuing technology was practicality, financial stability, and more recently the potential of travel and remote work. however, feeling stretched in so many directions and desperate for more time, i'm deciding to withdraw from school once again as soon as possible. i'm not passionate about technology at all, and hate the idea of another thing pulling me further away or holding me back any longer from returning to making music, or art in general. i've worried about this being a mistake, and contemplated my decision for a while now, but i don't think i'm convincing anyone that it's right for me. the idea of working in technology seems cool as a concept, but it's not what i truly want to pursue, it's just another means to an end that sucks up my time, energy, and sense of self. my current goals are to save up as much as i can, head to europe somehow, and make music again as soon as possible. i wish to do much more creatively than just make music one day, but i feel so far away, held back beyond just mental struggles but also in the past few years by trying to force my way through jobs like a square peg in a round hole. i just always seem to end up feeling burnt out and suicidal. i would be so thankful to be making music again. i really miss playing games even. wanting to do any of it. maybe even watching movies. i try to make use of my drive time, workout time, etc, to listen to things on youtube and such for inspiration, or the music i listen to. i've tried audio books and stuff. i'm just so unhappy with this life that nothing works, probably knowing all inspiration is pointless when actually doing anything with it is indefinitely, potentially forever held off, due to how exhausted and busy i always am, physically and mentally. \n\naround me there is one restaurant that i've considered applying to, but i'm worried that i will only feel the same amount of worry about my health if not more, as i likely would be seen as even more strange for wearing an n95 there than at my current workplace where i already wear gloves and an apron. i've tried to inform my coworkers about my celiac. they're really kind to me despite how weird and i guess gay they think i am lol. it sucks, if i didn't have celiac, i really don't think things would be this difficult at all. i really work with cool people and i try my best to be positive and social while i'm there. however, the other two bussers end up seeing just how miserable i am. other than the other restaurant though, jobs around me are very dead end i guess, low paying at a college i live next to or retail, the best paying of which being walmart, which was my last job, OGP, that i had also quit after months, burnt out and feeling probably even more suicidal. i've considered a small ingles and just really trying to go all in on art. i could be miserable there too though.\n\ni almost feel like quitting this job with no plan and with what savings i have, about 8 thousand, is my truest path, but i also just can't stand the idea of being in this place any longer. i'm worried i'd just fall into a deeper depression and not have any art even come out of it. though i feel like the chances with that route are almost higher than they are right now. i'm trying to bet on europe and traveling, but today i'm feeling so bad that i don't feel a desire to exist anywhere in this world. i'm very fortunate to live with my mom and stepdad, but i just feel like my room and all, this entire area i live in beyond this house, it's tainted with so much trauma from my personal mental health struggles after a really bad relationship when i was younger. my contamination OCD had improved a lot as it was extremely severe, but now learning that i have celiac, it's come back in a new way that is based on something more logical and actually physically harmful. it sucks so much and i feel so sad.\n\ni had gotten off of my meds for a while but i've now been back on half of my dose for a while. it just feels like the problem is beyond being mentally ill and is really just an unfortunate tricky situation but i will likely up my dosage back to what it used to be or find another medication. again i'm 21 and am feeling pressure to figure things out. it's weird, i honestly miss being a loser and playing counter strike all day, depressed out of my mind yet not so stressed. i don't want expensive things, or an expensive life, i just wish i could live simply somehow, and make art and music. i'm sorry to vent a ton and i hope i don't come off as too pathetic or whiny. honestly, i just am so unhappy and don't know what to do. if i'm being completely honest, i would much rather not be alive than to keep living and feeling like this. it's nearly impossible to navigate plans, think any creative thoughts (a few months ago at this job i had some though now my head is nearly silent), to feel like life is worth it at all. i'm noticing my struggle increasing to do basic things, having to force myself to move as my natural state right now is like a mental paralysis. it's like my body wants to be still and stare off into nothing, with no thoughts going on at all. i'm just so depressed.",

        "selftext": "I want to know about what steps to take in my case, how long the process might take, what are the possible legal consequences for the defendant, what might be used against me, and if it is safe to use my story to raise awareness online using. I am not disclosing any personal details but I am talking about one person. I can say this happened in a major city in PA but I\u2019m not going to disclose which one publicly. \n\nI am no longer in this situation. They do know where I currently live though because they have visited the place I am currently am at a few times. I haven\u2019t put together the exact order things happened or the date range it happened but everything happened within the last 11 months. Some of these things might not seem like much compared to everything else but it might prove a pattern. \n\nTo anyone who is not a legal expert, I know I wasn\u2019t that smart to stay in this relationship but for some reason, I thought the relationship was worth fighting for because of the small amount of times things were good. I also didn\u2019t leave right away because of their threats to my life. I also didn\u2019t realize I was necessarily being abused until I was out and I started talking about everything they did to me. I was miserable while I was with them in a relationship. \n\nThis is what happened with mentions of the evidence I have:\n- They injured me during intimacy one time and I had an open wound. Later, they yelled and screamed at me to get into a scolding hot bath. It was so hot that my feet started turning pink the moment I put my feet into the bath water. After I gave in and sat down in the bath water, they told me they had put bleach in the bath water too. I started crying wanting to get out so my PH doesn\u2019t get messed up. They yelled and screamed at me to get in. It progressively got so bad that I could barely walk to the ER because it hurt so much to even walk. I looked like I was walking how an elderly person \u201cshuffles\u201d or sometime like that. I was petrified with how they were acting. The er doctor told me it looked like a badly scraped knee and it was extremely irritated. The triage nurse was worried of chemical burns. When I told them this, they yelled at me for trusting the doctor over them and I should trust their home remedies they learned from their aunt or someone. \n- They threatened to come home from their job, making them lose their job, just to come home and \u201ccrash out\u201d on me and yell and scream at me. They usually mean beat people up when they say crash out. They threatened me multiple times.\n- They threatened to beat up and later murder the friends who tried to warn me of their red flags.\n- I heard from my friends, that they admitted to having a firearm they called their lawyer. They told me that they couldn\u2019t own a firearm because they are trigger happy and would end up shooting everyone except for me. I was so afraid when they said they would shoot people. Although, they also threatened me with a murder suicide if we didn\u2019t work out and or if I left them. I was scared because I knew they were capable of it.\n- I have scars under my breast because they popped my pimples even when I told them to stop, even when the were only bleeding, and even when I was I kinda screamed for moments. \n- When they were yelling at me one time, they got so mad that they slammed their phone to the ground right in front of me about a foot away from me. I was so afraid and I think they wanted to get physical with me that time. Their phone screen was shattered and it wasn\u2019t a delicate phone screen. They used to brag about how durable their phone was. I have a picture of their shattered phone screen.\n- I had to stand in the doorway to stop them from going out and murdering their elderly client at their old job. This client had accused them of threatening their life and they temporarily lost their job because of it. \n- They recorded me during intimacy without my consent twice and sent me both videos because they thought I would like it. I told them both times that I do not like being recorded without my consent. The first time they did it, their excuse was they wanted to prank me by anonymously emailing me the video just to see how I would react. They wanted to see how I would react if someone tried to blackmail me with that video.\n- They convinced me it was safe to have sex with someone who had HIV as long as the person used protection and I had a prep pill before and after intercourse. I wouldn\u2019t have done it if I realized the risks. \n- They never used protection, even when I asked, they would try to tell me why they really didn\u2019t want to. I had so many pregnancy scares. They told me that if I ever got pregnant, that I would have to tell them and they would\u2019ve never wanted me to get an abortion even if we could not afford a child. They also said that if we did have kids, that they wouldn\u2019t hit them, but they would tap them. This was their was of saying that they would hit them but not as bad as they was hit. \n- Many times when we argued they would threaten to leave me as a manipulation tactic to not make them feel bad about triggering me. They triggered me when they yelled at me because of past trauma. Looking back, I wish they would left me but I\u2019m pretty sure most of the time, they were empty threats.\n- They had me take out a credit card because they was financially irresponsible. I was so afraid of them that I got this card so they wouldn\u2019t blow up on me for not doing it. They also sometimes took my card without asking me or spent more than they told me they would. I didn\u2019t really have a choice either way. When we didn\u2019t have the money to eat and we would ask people for money, they would spend it all on unnecessary things. Whenever they asked others for money for their meds or mood stabilizers, it never spent on that. They spent last least a few grand on unnecessary things during our 10 months of being together. They had me ask my dad for $3000 because they was so bad with how they chose to spend our money that we would never have enough money for rent. Luckily, $2000 was forgiven for my graduation present. The electric was in my name and we still have $500 in debt to them. Oh, and because we couldn\u2019t pay the rent, we got evicted and now owe them over $3000. I\u2019m just glad that the lease was in both of our names. \n- They used to yell at me to stop crying and whenever I looked sad, they told me to fix my face. They would yell at me until I started crying and then got mad at me for my reaction. They told me my crying was like a 12 year old having at temper tantrum. They told me my crying was unintentional manipulation.\n- I was always walking on eggshells not knowing what would set them off and make them start yelling or screaming at me so much that it got to the point that I didn\u2019t know what decisions to make or what to say. I never knew what would make her mad next. I lost my autonomy and it got to the point where they made me feel like nobody else could put up with me and that I couldn\u2019t even take care of myself. \n- I had to start going on the bus without paying the bus fare because they were so bad with money. I also had to stop taking my meds for over 3 months because I couldn\u2019t afford them with how they were spending our money. They pretty much decided where our money went. I couldn\u2019t afford to see my therapist or psychiatrist because it wasn\u2019t budgeted so I got discharged from seeing anyone for my mental health. It was more than just an insurance issue. If we budgeted it, it was possible to keep seeing them both. \n- They put their used sex toys in the bag of stuff. It was not washed. I think they did it to mess with me. It was really gross and smelled bad. \n\nWhat evidence I have and other things that might support my case:\n- Bleach incident: Medical records, text messages, and paper trail from when I asked AI for advice on the situation.\n- Threats: I have evidence of them talking about beating people up (including two of my friends), a stranger, and me (they implied that she wanted to hurt me).\n- Wanting to murder elderly client: The client had accused them of threatening their life and I know their name and the employer so I can reach them. I have proof that they had homicidal ideation when they texted a group chat about wanting to murder this person who she fought.\n- I have the non consensual recording in my phone.\n- My friends have text messages in a group chat where they claimed to own a firearm that they named their lawyer.\n- I have a photo of their broken phone screen.\n- I have active debt and I never had any issues with money management before this. I never missed a bill or had my account overdrafted.\n- I have text messages of them being angry and telling me to stop pouting, crying, looking sad, etc. I also have text messages explaining my feelings.\n- I have a witness willing to testify who experience more severe SA, was coerced into asking others for money, and was forced to break and enter by them. \n- I have a witness that was also recorded without their consent.\n- They have an active and pending felony fraud charge. Because of this, they have talked about fleeing if they ever got caught by law enforcement. They are a flight risk and it is likely they will retaliate against anything I do.\n- I just received evidence today that they may have been on meth right before we broke up. I have other evidence of illegal activities not much related to what they did to me personally.",

        "title": "My journey to deism",
        "selftext": "I grew up in a Christian fundamentalist household (or at least my dad specifically was and still is one). When I was a kid, I used to believe in most of the stuff he would watch and spew from conspiracy theories about the Illuminati, anti-Catholicism (I wasn't really anti-Catholic), homophobia, young-Earth creationism,  KJV-onlyism, and so on. It was greatly influential on me, and I would also spew this out as well.\n\nIt wasn't until freshman year of highschool where I started to question my faith, so I became an atheist, like an edgy type where I view anyone who was religious as delusional or an idiot. When I did became an atheist, I still believed in most of the things my dad told me, but not the religion stuff. Fortunately, as I gotten older, I became less and less fundamentalist and became a lot more open-minded. And also stopped with the edgy atheist type, and became more moderate on it as well.\n\nWhich now brings me to 2023. This was by far the worst year for me, and it took a toll on my mental health. I had to cut ties with someone, my cat died that year from cancer. These two things made me felt hopeless and depressed. I started to have a existential crisis and it was all so overwhelming.\n\nNow we go to 2024. 2024 started out a lot worse for me as my depression from 2023 continued. My mental health was really low here. I didn't feel like doing much of anything such as playing video games or voice acting. I didn't even had it in me to end it all either, but I did felt so lonely. Luckily, in March or April of that year, I got a DM on Reddit from someone that if I wanted to join an adult only discord server full of Nintendo fans, and given how shitty my mental health was at the time, I accepted it immediately.  And it helped considerably, and I met some really cool people there too. Even though, for a little a while, I wasn't really that active there until mid 2024. I know I kinda went on a tangent there, but this was honestly important to the story, if I wasn't for this Discord server, I probably wouldn't be here today, let alone had this journey.\n\nNow we go to late 2024, this is where I started getting philosophical. I started to think about where we came from and why are we here. I was honestly thinking of either going back to being a Christian, but not the fundie type, or be agnostic. And then, I started to type on Google about the types of religions, and I stumbled upon deism. And I forgot that deism was a thing, and I wanted to see if it best describe me, and it really did. I was still debating on what I should be. And then finally on December of 2024, I became a deist and it really has helped. While I don't consider myself a Christian deist, but Christianity has influenced my deistic beliefs. Believing in a supreme being while not following any religion has improved my mental health a lot.\n",

I can't hear it tbh\n\n\\[My Yellow Flags as Described by Me\\]\n\n\u2022 I can warm up very quickly, so expect actual compliments and words of affirmation  \n\u2022 I'm a people pleaser, I try to look for the good in everyone, even if they don't deserve it  \n\u2022 I can over-fixate on passionate projects\n\n\\[My Red Flags as Described by Me\\]\n\n\u2022 I'm quite open about my emotions for a guy  \n\u2022 I'm a little clingy, I'm trying to work on it  \n\u2022 I'm an overthinker about everything..  \n\u2022 I keep expecting the worst in everything, I think nothing will work out for me\n\n\\[My Dream Jobs\\]\n\n\u2022 Mechanics/Engineering  \n\u2022 Forensics, and what I mean by Forensics..

This is in combination of well.. actual working notifications (thanks reddit) and potential VC's in the future  \n\u2022 Instagram is also a potential option if Discord is out of the question\n\nI hope this has convinced you.. that I'm worth talking to? If I did, shoot me a message, hope to hear from you \ud83d\ude42",

        "title": "AITAH for not having a relationship with my MIL and SIL at this point?",
        "selftext": "\n\n\nSorry this is a long post! \n\n\u26a0\ufe0fTW: this post mentions Miscarriages \n\n\nI (28F) have been married to my husband (29M) for 2 years and I don\u2019t have a relationship with my MIL (Mother in law) or SIL (sister in law). When I first started dating my now husband everything with them seemed fine, I did my best to make a good impression, and tried to start forming relationships with them as I obviously wanted them to like me. While we were dating everything seemed fine and they always told my husband how much they liked me, etc. However, once we got engaged things definitely took a turn. \n\nUpfront they seemed excited about our engagement, and we thought everything was great. Until my SIL started actively avoiding us. When we would try to invite her, and her husband to do stuff with us they would say we were \u201ctoo poor to hang out with\u201d among other excuses. After that we stopped inviting them all together. In addition to avoiding us she would always make snide comments at anything I liked or wore. At our engagement party she took all of our champagne to her in laws house from the party. She then proceeded to drink all of it after she ignored me the whole time, and was rude to my sister whom it was her first time meeting. At this time is also when my SIL began copying me.\n\nI am an avid gym goer and was in pretty decent shape. After finding out that I go to the gym my SIL became a part of an MLM fitness scheme. If I would post about working out at a gym to hold myself accountable, she would immediately post why at home workouts are superior to the gym and advertise the workouts/supplements to try and get people to buy into the MLM. She also markets herself as a fitness coach and influencer, she does not have a fitness or health degree/cert whatsoever. \n\n I also changed careers as the job I had just was not working out. A few months later my SIL quit her job where she was a manager, and made good money to go to a company that is a direct competitor of my company. She took a lower salary just to do the same job as me. She even went as far demanding to be in the same department as me just at the other company when she had only worked there for 3 months. \n\nIn addition, shortly after she got the same job as me she traded in her previous car for a car that is older just to have the same car as me. At first I thought these were just weird coincidences. More to come on that later\u2026\n\nI probably should also mention my MIL and SIL are like \u201cbesties\u201d they talk and gossip with each other all the time. While engaged, my MIL hosted a party at their house. She proceeded to invite one of my husband\u2019s exes which she was still good friends with despite this girl being 30 years younger than my MIL, and her son\u2019s ex. My MIL was so close with her that she would invite my husband\u2019s ex to do \u2018girl stuff\u2019 if my SIL was not available. Meanwhile, I was never invited by my MIL. While at my in laws, this ex was attempting to be friendly with my now husband. As soon as I walked into the house she then went into the other room, and was crying to my MIL because she was hurt that my husband was with someone else... My MIL and SIL proceeded to comfort her while I was in the corner literally wanting to die. It was so incredibly awkward. My husband confronted them and they basically proceeded to pretend like they didn\u2019t know/that they didn\u2019t do that. \n\nP.S. after that the ex stopped hanging out or wanting anything to do with my MIL. \n\n\nCloser to the wedding my SIL was upset because she didn\u2019t receive any info about a bachelorette party, I didn\u2019t have a bachelorette party because my Maid of honor was my sister who I am very close with. She was underage at the time, and I also didn\u2019t have any close girlfriends either so it seemed impractical to have a bachelorette party with just me and my SIL. My SIL went crying to my father in law about it which was then relayed to me by my FIL. I politely let them know that I wasn\u2019t having a bachelorette party which they didn\u2019t seem to believe me, and thought I was just lying/just didn\u2019t want to invite my SIL. \n\nFast forward to 3 weeks before our wedding, my SIL was in charge of the bachelor party because she was the best woman. My husband got a text stating that the only weekend that works for his bachelor party is a week before our wedding because her, and her husband would be out of town prior to then. When asked what the plan was for the bachelor party the details were very vague and she didn\u2019t have a real plan yet. So I very nicely texted her and asked if I could have the details once she knew so I could plan my weekend. She said she would let me know. 4 days before the bachelor party is supposed to happen I follow up again, and she still has no details. 2 days before the bachelor party I reach out to her, and just say that I\u2019m not appreciating the lack of communication. At this point I am very upset, and I also let her know that I found out from one of my husbands friends what the plan for the bachelor party was. To which she freaks out on me, and then proceeds to tell my in laws that I\u2019m being a bitch because I expressed my dislike to not being communicated with. To take the pettiness even further my SIL, MIL ,and my SIL\u2019s friends all go to the bachelor party and post about it in the family group chat that I am unfortunately in. Essentially trying to be petty towards me by excluding me from the \u201cfamily\u201d outing.\n\nOn our actual wedding day; my MIL or SIL didn\u2019t say two words to me at our ceremony. Not a compliment, a congratulations, or anything. My SIL wanted to get pictures taken of her and her husband for her to post and that was it. At our reception my SIL proceeds to not talk to me at all, and my MIL only interacts with me to tell me how left out I made my SIL feel because I didn\u2019t have events to invite her to, and because we didn\u2019t want her help planning our wedding. \n\n\nAfter our wedding my SIL continues to not talk to me or my husband for various shallow reasons most of them having to do with money and how they think we are poor. Once my birthday rolls around. My FIL plans a dinner at a nice restaurant for my birthday. This is a dress code type of restaurant. My SIL and her husband show up in t-shirts, jeans and baseball caps. To which people are actually laughing at them as they walk in. Please keep in mind my SIL had a dress code for her birthday dinner and the restaurant was not fancy at all yet she still made sure that everyone dressed up. At the end of the night they wanted me to open my SIL\u2019s present. I opened the bag and there is a bag of candy, and 2 bottles of soda as my present from my SIL. Please note that any holiday/birthday my SIL only asks for expensive gifts. In the past I had bought her a few items to which she either lost or broke. So I felt a bit insulted that she expects all of these expensive gifts but I get a bag of candy and 2 bottles of soda. This would be a cool gift if I was 12, not 26 (at the time). I am also not a huge soda or candy person. \n\nFast forward a few months after that event, my SIL calls my husband to tell them that they unfortunately had a miscarriage. To which he said he was so sorry and to let us know if anything was needed from us. About a week later I get off of work very late and I look at my phone to see texts in a group chat that she had surgery.  I was never told she was having surgery previous to those messages. Since it was very late I was going to just reach out in the morning so I didn\u2019t wake/disturb her. The next morning we were up super early to run some errands. I know my SIL is not an early riser, and again I don\u2019t want to disturb her sleep so we run our errands with the intent that I would reach out to her later at a more appropriate time of day. Upon returning home I receive a very aggressive text from my MIL that  I don\u2019t care that my SIL\u2019s baby died and that I must think it\u2019s stupid, and  basically going off on me saying all of these horrible things about me because I hadn\u2019t texted her yet. So my husband calls his mom and basically goes off about what happened and that I was going to reach out at a better time of day. After this my in laws are too distraught about the miscarriage and they don\u2019t really talk to us for several months. \n\nShortly after that I find out I\u2019m pregnant. I tell my in laws because I had severe nausea and it was hard to hide that I was feeling sick. Plus my in laws are big drinkers so it would have been hard to hide anyways. We are told we cannot tell my SIL and her husband because they are still too distraught. To which we understand and keep it on the DL. Unfortunately, at 6 weeks pregnant I also have a miscarriage. My husband not wanting my SIL to find out via someone else he calls to tell her that we had a miscarriage to which she responded \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were trying\u201d. \n\nWe continue to try to get pregnant and unfortunately despite doctors not finding any reason as to why I miscarried in the first place we do not get pregnant. It took a severe toll on our lives and mental health.\n\nA few months prior to our wedding anniversary my MIL asks what we are doing for our first anniversary and we tell her where we have dinner reservations not thinking anything of it. My SIL\u2019s anniversary is right before ours and they posted about going to the same restaurant as the one we had reservations for, and then later complained to my in laws that we copied them on their anniversary dinner. Later we found out that my SIL asked my MIL to ask us where we were going. \n\nAdditionally, on our first wedding anniversary, my in laws offered to watch our dogs. So my husband took our dogs over to his parents house and I stayed home to get ready to go to dinner. When he goes over there to drop the dogs off my SIL announced that she\u2019s pregnant. On our first wedding anniversary after we\u2019d been having fertility issues and suffered a miscarriage. To top it all off my FIL was angry that I didn\u2019t go with my husband because I was at home getting ready for our anniversary dinner. Needless to say our night was ruined. \n\nThroughout my SIL\u2019s pregnancy they would use holidays to announce various things. Thanksgiving they announced the gender, and Christmas was full of gifts for the unborn baby. My husband and I were cordial about it and would say congrats or things like that. We also just were not in a good headspace at all when it came to babies and pregnancy due to our failed attempts/miscarriage. So we often were dealing with our own conflicting emotions while also trying to be happy for them. My in laws basically pretended like we never had a miscarriage and didn\u2019t understand why we felt the way we felt about my SIL\u2019s pregnancy. \n\n\nThe worst of it was my 27th birthday\u2026on my birthday they turned the whole day into it being about them because they decided they just had to announce their baby\u2019s name at my birthday celebration unbeknownst to me.  Originally, they weren\u2019t going to tell anyone the name until after the birth. \n\nWe had hoped once the baby was born that it would get better and maybe things would change between us all. But it in fact seemed to make it worse. Since then my  SIL has repeatedly gone out of her way to try to have a relationship with my husband while still not putting any effort into having any kind of a relationship with me. My husband has set those boundaries with her and let her know that she cannot have a relationship with him until she treats me better and puts in some effort to have a relationship with me. \n\nTo which she then started to copy everything I do even more. If I post about the gym she immediately would post her workout. I even did it intentionally to see if she really was copying me on and off for about a week. If I posted about it so did she. If I don\u2019t post about it, neither does she. \n\nI recently cut my hair and she saw it one of the times we went over to my in laws house. Then the next week she got her hair cut the exact same way. \n\nI mentioned wanting to get a tattoo. She went to the exact same tattoo artist I go to and got a tattoo before me. Might I add the tattoo artist I go to is also my cousins husband? \n\nMy husband and I are getting into golf, guess who else has a sudden interest in golf? \n\nIf I do my nails, she gets hers done the exact same way. \n\nIt has become so bad that I blocked my SIL on social media and then she threw a fit to my in laws so I ultimately ended up having to unblock her because the drama it was causing was horrendous. I do now have it so that she and my MIL cannot see any of my posts or stories. \n\nBut unfortunately if my MIL sees me in person and notices I have something new, or my nails are done a certain way, it seems she tells my SIL. Because the next week my SIL will post and lo and behold she will have the exact same thing that my mother in law saw me with. \n\nAt this point, I feel like I cannot do anything, buy anything, or say anything because she is going to go out and do or buy the exact same things. \n\n\nTo make matters worse my husband has talked to my in laws multiple times over the years about all of the stuff with his sister and they don\u2019t really seem to care. In their eyes his sister can do no wrong, and we are always made out to be the bad guys. As long as we can all portray the image of the perfect family that\u2019s all they seem to care about. \n\n\n\n\n",

Usually I wouldve felt very tired, and I took a bath which usually makes me even more tired, but here I am still wide awake at 01:43 even though I went to bed at around 21:30. \n\nSuddenly I feel VERY awake for no reason, even though Im laying down it feels like Im falling in space and my heart is beating like crazy. I just want to run outside, or like finish my spring cleaning I started recently, hit my head against the wall anything to get rid of it. I eat setraline and I dont feel particularly anxious or depressed about anything specific at tye moment, and I also eat Inderal for anxiety heart palpitations but it hasnt had any effect. So I dont think its anxiety. I thought it maybe was hunger becaue I forgot to eat all day when I was at school so I tried drinking some milk which usually helps with my hunger cues but the restlessness is still there. \n\nI feel so trapped in my bed but I know if I start working it now will fuck up my sleep schedule for the rest of the week and I have school work that needs to be handed in soon, and I will aslo accidentally wake my boyfriend sjnce he is a lifht sleeper. I used to self harm but Ive managed to recover somewhat and now I only hurt myself maybe every 5 months, but this shit has triggered those horrible thoughts again in full. I just want to cut and hit myself again and my mind keeps showing me images even when I dont want to. \n\nMaybe I will go for a run. ",

        "title": "AITA for how I left my color guard team?",
        "selftext": "TW: breif mentions of suicidal thoughts and attempted SH\n\nThis is going to be a super long one and have a lot of background info and people so I'll try to keep this as organized as possible.\n\nThe main people involved are me (14-15F when this all occurred),  the guard director who we'll call Purple (mid 30s F), Lucy and Sally (both my age), and the band director, Patty (40ish M). All other people mentioned will most likely be my age unless otherwise stated.\n\nFor a little background, I joined color guard (we throw flags with the band and have our own comps, super awesome sport, highly recommend) freshman year (2023-2024) and right off the bat things were a bit amiss. Also to note, I have severe depression and anxiety, and also have ADHD, which hinders my ability to learn as quickly as other people (The ADHD was undiagnosed at the time but was very clear I had it). I was very upfront with Patty, Purple and the girls about this and they all seemed to understand and were willing to accommodate (at least the girls were). Also to note, Purple is the CG director at another school (and actually employed there) and our team is her little pity project. There's about 12-14 of us and her other guard is like 3 teams of like 25-30 and their school gets a shit ton of money. Purple is mostly with her main school so most of this occurs late Aug-Nov. of last year.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with HS marching band, we start in July and go on until football season is over in November (evil ik), and Purple wasn't with us until school started in August. Summer band was amazing, the problems didn't occur until Purple was coaching us more frequently. The best way to explain her teaching style is subdued Abby Lee Miller from Dance Moms (she kind of looks like her too lol). I told her straight up that her teaching style would be a problem with all my mental health issues (also I start crying if people raise their voice at me). Purple understood and would try to accommodate (obviously didn't happen). Overall, the atmosphere got incredibly toxic among the members and I, they got more frustrated with me when I didn't pick up choreo fast enough, or forgot it, or spaced out, which was never an issue before. Purple started getting more snappy and yelled at me more often, which in turn made me cry, which made her more irritated, which made me cry harder. This happened almost everyday during morning practice and eventually the members got fed up of my \"antics\" as well. And the main member who dogged on me was Sally. Sally was like my best friend in guard and she helped me a lot during summer band. Her more aggressive behavior didn't begin until Purple came back.\n\nDear Redditors, you may be asking, why didn't you tell someone? Why did Patty not do anything? How did no one notice how Purple's behavior was affecting you? I told several people, many times, Patty is a great teacher but horribly incompetent in all other aspects, and only two people noticed the toll this was taking on me: Lucy and one of the captains who we'll call Mary (16F). Both have known me a long time. Mary was my friend back in elementary school and Lucy is one of my best friends from middle school and has seen and helped me throughout almost all of my mental health struggles. Lucy made sure to teach me choreo I didn't get  help me calm down during crying episodes and Mary tried to help with the \"admin\" side of things. At the worst of the drama, I was having panic attacks everyday, crying after almost every practice, going home early all the time, skipping practice due to the anxiety (which didn't help my already kind of crumbling relationship with the team) and caused my grades to slip. \nFor a more context, American school sports is run by an organization called UIL. UIL also runs marching band comps as it's considered a sport. The rules state that you must be passing all classes in order to perform at football games and competitions. Because my grades were slipping below 70 I couldn't perform, making the members even more upset with me. Towards the end of the season I became extremely withdrawn and I started contemplating wanting to die and tried cutting myself with kiddie scissors.\n\nFinally, the season was over, I said over my dead body am I doing winterguard (Purple runs the entire freaking thing) and left amicably.\nAfter that, I made up with Sally and a couple others, I hung out with them, went to some of their performances and talked out all of the issues I had with marching season.\n\nFast forward to end of the school year and I decide to rejoin guard. I start summer band and immediately realize despite all the heartfelt talks and promises to do better the same bullshit starts up again. Also around this time the captains found some of my old tiktoks of me trashing guard and told Patty. Patty told my mom, we had a meeting with him and the two subs for Purple (who I love and still talk to when I see them) and Paty was basically like \"we can't fire her, maybe try to adapt to her teaching style idk what to tell you\" and the subs were like \"you seemfine when we're there, sure the girls seem a little hostile but you do what you need to\"\nBy the end of the meeting both me and my mom were like screw y'all (not aloud) and I quit again.\nThe captains understood and so did the veterans (what we call returning members) except Sally. Sally stopped returning my texts, liking Insta posts and stories, and overall seemed to withdraw herself from me. Once school started I noticed the gap more and confronted her over Snapchat. Basically, Sally said that she didn't like how I trashed talked her friends and that if I knew I was just going to quit again I should've just not rejoined, and brought up an incident with a friend of ours as her reasons.\n\nA. I never trash talked the members, I trashed Purple and how the team's behavior hurt me\nB. I thought everyone understood all of my issues with last year and how to resolve them\nC. The situation with the friend didn't even involve Sally, me and the friend made up ages ago, and you aren't even friends with her anymore\n\nSally got like mad upset and said that she needs time to gather her thoughts and for now don't directly interact with her. I said okay and we left it at that. That was last October.\n\nNow, I kind of want to extend an olive branch to her and a few other members I was close to and fell out of touch with. AITA for how I left guard and how should I go about reconnecting with the members?",

I saw you get hurt by a guy you trusted, I saw the pain in your beautiful soul and my heart leapt to help you heal it. You showed me how to love and protect and care for someone. Anytime I helped you with a problem or pushed light into your life it made my soul warm and my heart full.\n\nWe always considered ourselves friends and I respected that. I grew closer to you and never told you how much you mean to me face to face.\n\n2 weeks ago I lost you. It happened all so fast during times of tribulation and stress. I was faced with being away from my family for more than a few hours for the first time in my 34 years of existence. I may have been pushy about seeing you that night but I needed you as a friend.\n\nYou disconnected. You left me on unread for 10 days +. You did not return my calls. Left me feeling hopeless about what I did to hurt you. I tried it all to figure it out. I heard nothing. My friends told me to drive to your house and get answers if you feel it in your heart.\n\nI got in my car straight after work drove up there knowing I was putting myself in an embarassing situation. Probaly the biggest in my life. I rang  the bell, I called I waited. 1 hour later your friend arrived and told me it was not ok what I did. But I told her the pain I was in and how I did not want to lose you. I cried on the drive home knowing I did the last thing I could do to get some sort of closure. Maybe I did it all to fast but it was for my heart break to heal a little faster.\n\nYou messaged me that night. Telling me to stay away and do not contact you. You blocked me on social media and took me out of your life made me feel like something I am not. I wish I could reverse it all. You were out of my life sooner than I ever expected. Only time will tell if I will ever be able to know if you are well in life and happy. For now I suppose I have to carry on with my own life. The river of tears is flowing strong currently, but I know eventually a new sun will shine and drive them out.\n\nThank you for being the first girl to teach me about love, and heartbreak, and all the feelings in between.\n\nI will miss you Sunshine. But I guess time changes the weather day by day.",

        "selftext": "I have such bad fear of missing out. I am afab nb22. Undiagnosed autistic and unable to get tested due to lack of privileges for poc population in the country in which i reside in rn. I haven\u2019t been to university yet, i feel like i am just growing old and by the time i am 30 i will regret everything. My life\u2019s biggest motto and goal is to take pride in every decision i have ever made and to never have a regret. Even though it\u2019s hard i try to live by it and not doubt myself. But lately; in the evening i feel like everyday is passing by and i am not doing much. I am just sitting here idly and that\u2019s it; like even tho i am doing a lot of stuff that i want to do it doesn\u2019t feel like i am taking every advantage that i should be taking of my youth. I already feel so old because i am 22 and i see all these 17 year olds getting ready for collage and frats and it feels like they have it all and i am just here like haha i moved out, i have two cats, live with my s/o whose also 22 and have AuDHD and we don\u2019t do anything haha that\u2019s it. Like i know if i have a few drinks the social anxiety is mellowed down a little and i can socialise pretty decently and mask even better and don\u2019t get a strong hangover if i am well prepared but i feel like i have no friends or well one irl friend w ADHD who is on an Asia solo trip so irl I technically have no friends, my s/o doesn\u2019t want to do anything just stay inside which I understand. I used to think that oh if i just have one person to do smth w then it would be fun but nah I don\u2019t have anyone and I just feel like I am missing out so much of my youth and I can\u2019t do anything and I just have meltdowns and shutdowns and cry and that\u2019s it. When I was 18 and stuff I didn\u2019t had any friends still but I partook in hookup culture and partied back in high school and even w an  outcast feeling it felt as if there was a moment of feeling oke but now I just feel like I am not doing anything that a typical 22 year should be doing? Like Ik I m also not a typical 22 year old but still; I want to have fun while I am alive but everything just seems so against me. Like I want to go to the club and bar and just have fun but I don\u2019t have anyone to do it with?? And not to mention the club near our apartment is also just filled with risky people so it\u2019s never safe to go alone either so I just feel like I am not doing much because I don\u2019t have anyone to do anything with and I am just growing old and I feel hopeless everyday way more than the day before.  I dont only mean this by bars and clubs and I am using this as a real life exemple so I also mean this with oh going somewhere like the botanical garden together and doing something or even playing a game together with someone, it feels like I just want all those things that a neurotypical teenage girl would want but unfortunately I\u2019m a soul that\u2019s stuck in a autistic body of a 22 year old.  Now a days everything just costs so much too so I understand but it just feels like right when I decided to grow up everything just went nope thanks to capitalism. So what do you do when you feel like you are missing out at everything in your life? ",

        "selftext": "Hi! I\u2019m a 14F. I started my period when I just turned 12. I have had major problems but as we know doctors don\u2019t do \ud83d\udca9. so I\u2019m here on Reddit for help. \n\nAnyway I am going to divide my list of problems below!\n\n(Mention of suicide)\n\nStomach issues and constipation: \nWhen I was 12 started to have extreme stomach pain and constipation.  It caused me to be in incredible pain. I would only poop IF I WAS LUCKY once a week. I\u2019ve been to the walk in clinic many times for this specific issue and they just tell me to do a clean out. The thing is it doesn\u2019t help. Temporarily, yes. But it goes back to before right afterwards. I have little to no bowel movement. When I do get the chance to number 2 I am always in dying pain. Words cannot express or describe the agitating feeling. Present day, it\u2019s gotten a bit better. But still at least once a month I am having the most intense pain whenever I poop. It gets to the point I have to take a plastic bag and poop in the shower in pain.\n\nIrregular periods:\nI haven\u2019t struggled with this much, most of my periods last around 6 to 8ish days. The longest period I\u2019ve had was 2 weeks. The shortest was around 2 days. Most of the time it\u2019s really consistent. Genuinely not much to say about this topic, but I will say I think my periods are a bit longer than average.\n\nHeavy flow: \nMy flow has always been INCREDIBLY heavy. I just started my period today and I have already seen multiple blood clots the size of a nickel or bigger. I use period underwear, which I go through MULTIPLE of them a day. Which I have to switch because I literally bleed through them. I have worn pads before (but not for a full day of wearing) I would estimate if I did I would go through atleast 6 or even more per day. I\u2019ve gotten up from the bathtub and there has been blood clots, even on the floor.\n\nPain:\nOh good gosh this one. I do not think words I write will ever compare or even comprehend the pain I\u2019ve experienced. My periods have always left me in pain, but it was manageable. Around summer/fall of 2023 things got SO bad. I would be on the toilet 24/7. I would scream in pain. I couldn\u2019t sleep because of the pain, only when my body just forcefully shuts down. Nothing would help, Motrin, Tylenol, nada. I know I\u2019ve already said this but I genuinely can not put into words how much pain I was and am in. \n\nI would beg and cry to my mom to take me to the emergency room. Which we did so. Every. Single. Month. We waited there for hours in agonizing pain-only for them to only offer me a higher dose of ibuprofen. Their advice was just to simple take it every so often. \ud83d\ude11 as if that wasn\u2019t what I had been doing.\n\nI showed up the next month, same thing-just ibuprofen!!!!! \ud83d\ude11 I showed up once again the next month in excruciating pain just as always. They FINALLY took me the tiniest bit seriously, and gave me an IV. Yay! That should help, right? Nope! Did absolutely nothing. Thankful after the next few months went by it was easier to manage.\n\n\n(THE WORST PILL EVER) my story with birth control:\nOnce again! I ended up at the check in clinic because of cramps. Long story short the only thing they could do was offer birth control, yay for doctors that don\u2019t even do the bare minimum!!!!!!! Anyway. I started it, and not even days later I felt better. Woohoo!!! But, I have ocd which got extremely worse in just the span of 3 days. On the 4th night I almost took my life because I was on that pill. It took a MONTH to get rid of the thoughts and feelings.  Anyway that\u2019s just the basics as I don\u2019t feel like talking about that traumatic night anymore.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a gynecologist. It didn\u2019t help. She told me to start birth control again, which I declined  after that experience I\u2019ve had. I feel as though nobody is taking me seriously. I KNOW nobody is taking me seriously. This has been a problem for years yet I\u2019m still not getting help. I\u2019ve been to the ER more than 4 times and been to check in clinics about a thousand times. Nobody even bothers. I hate doctors so much. I need help. This isn\u2019t normal. I\u2019m 14. I shouldn\u2019t be spending two weeks of my month sobbing in pain, unable to go anywhere. \n\nI am sick. I am crying. I want to be taken seriously. My problems are problems but everyone is excusing them. I am suffering and nobody wants to help. :(\n\nAnyway. I just need support and possibly help. Do I have endometriosis? Is this \u201cnormal\u201d? Why is this happening?",

J'ai explos\u00e9 et envoy\u00e9 des vocaux d'insultes, qu'il a gard\u00e9 et avec lesquels ils menacent de nuire \u00e0 ma r\u00e9putation.\n\nJ'ai donc rencontr\u00e9 une personne d'ici qui le conna\u00eet et qui fr\u00e9quente r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement le bar o\u00f9 cet homme\nIl m'a dit d'ignorer et de ne rien faire, de retourner dans ce bar et de ne pas avoir peur de le croiser au Flon.\n\nDepuis une semaine, je vomissais chaque matin de stress, impossible d'aller en cours sans pleurer et paniquer. Samedi je suis sortie rejoindre des amies au carnaval, on a crois\u00e9 le gars dans ce bar. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenue par mes amies qui voulait absolument aller l\u00e0-bas et qui m'ont prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.\n\nJe croise dans l\u2019intervalle des mineures qui m'indiquent que le gars en question les a d\u00e9j\u00e0 dragu\u00e9e. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re ignorer cette information.\n\nAujourd'hui je me d\u00e9cide enfin \u00e0 retourner en ville seule. Mais en arrivant au Flon, je dis bonjour \u00e0 mes t\u00eates habituelles et je me fais de suite dire que le gars depuis plusieurs mois :\n\n- raconterait que je lui cours apr\u00e8s pour coucher avec lui\n- que je serais une personnes manipulatrice dont il faut se m\u00e9fier\n- mens, transforme des propos sur moi\n- montre mes vocaux de crise et indique avoir \u00e9labor\u00e9 un plan pour me d\u00e9cr\u00e9dibiliser dans mon travail et si un jour j'\u00e9tais m\u00e9diatis\u00e9e\n\nSous le choc, je demande \u00e0 un ami de me rejoindre, et en cherchant un bar je vois le gars dans son bar habituel.\n\nJe dis \u00e0 mon ami qu'il peut rentrer et que je vais parler au gars et lui demander en passant de me rendre mon casque \u00e0 100 balles vu qu'en plus il ne l'utilise pas. J'arrive le gars se mets \u00e0 me hurler des insanit\u00e9s, \u00e0 recommencer les moqueries sur mes handicaps, mes traumatismes. Il m'invite \u00e0 me tuer, rigole de mes scarifications, encore de mds traumas et \u00e0 nouveau je craque et lui renverse sa bi\u00e8re sur sa t\u00eate.\n\nIl se met \u00e0 rire d'autant plus fort en disant que c'est exactement ce qu'il cherchait. Des gens viennent et de l'ext\u00e9rieur, c'est une femme valide qui vient de verser une bi\u00e8re sur la t\u00eate d'un SDF handicap\u00e9. Je passe \u00e9videmment pour la mauvaise personne d'autant que, bien qu'il m'ait indiqu\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait sa bi\u00e8re, il s'agissait en fait de la bi\u00e8re d'une amie \u00e0 lui qui arrivait.\n\nLe g\u00e9rant du bar me demande de rembourser la bi\u00e8re alors que je n'ai que 8frs sur mon compte et malgr\u00e9 mes explications, le fait que le gars se moque de choses graves me concernant et a racont\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les habitu\u00e9s du Flon ces horreurs.\n\nIl s'en fiche, dit ne pas prendre parti, malgr\u00e9 que le gars ait visiblement d\u00e9j\u00e0 pos\u00e9 probl\u00e8me en insultant des clients. Il me donne un avertissement, visiblement \u00e0 lui aussi.\n\nDe mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 j'ai appel\u00e9 la police pour qu'ils m'aident concernant les messages de ma crise sur son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Le gars s'est moqu\u00e9 en disant que la police ne ferait rien, qu'il avait pas peur et en effet la police n'a rien fait et m'a invit\u00e9 \u00e0 porter plainte pour les messages mais je n'ai pas la force. Le gars ricanait et je repense \u00e0 quand il m'a dit qu'il gagnait toujours.\n\nJe suis chez moi, malade et en pleurs, alors que j'ai vu ma psy et pris mes m\u00e9dicaments. Je suis d\u00e9sempar\u00e9, pas envie d'aller \u00e0 Cery ni au PLI. Je n'ai pas de solution, je suis humili\u00e9e et m\u00eame s'il est tr\u00e8s peu \u00e9cout\u00e9, le fait est qu'il crache sur moi en me nommant, alors m\u00eame qu'il a eu pour presque 1000frs d'aide de ma part. Ses menaces sont r\u00e9elles malgr\u00e9s ce qu'on pense. M\u00eame son amie quand elle m'a vu, a dit \"ah c'est \"elle\" \" avec d\u00e9dain, car il a parl\u00e9 de moi \u00e0 tout le monde qu'il croise au Flon.\n\nJe n'ai plus de solution.",

        "selftext": "\"I liked the philosophy behind the lyrics of this song. I like the idea of not being caught in a figure of eight. \u2018Better to love than give in to hate,\u2019 which now sounds to me like the US elections.\"-Paul McCartney, People,\u00a024 March 2017\n\nIt was recorded twice by McCartney. The first version, which appeared on the album, was co-produced with Trevor Horn and Steve Lipson on 9 November 1987.\n\n\"Very spontaneous, very rough; another two-day effort with Trevor\u2026The vocal is live, which I like with all that rough-ness\u2026 There were certain conditions\u2026 that I put on them. And\u2026 they made me do stuff that they hadn\u2019t heard me do recently\u2026 it was great, I really enjoyed it.\"-Paul McCartney, Club Sandwich, Summer 1989\n\nAccording to Horn and Lipson, however, the sessions were altogether less cordial. The producers spent several hours after McCartney left the studio reworking \u2018Figure Of Eight\u2019, changing the chords and making it, in Horn\u2019s words, \u201csound more modern\u201d.\n\n\"He came in the next morning and went berserk. He just went mad, like \u2018what have you been doing? What have you done?!\u2019 It was that sort of conversation and I remember at the time thinking that there are so many aspects to this that are interesting. Firstly, what is the problem? Yeah, we did a bit of work on it, secondly he was in a real mood. Maybe something had happened before he got to the studio, I don\u2019t know. It was just a weird moment. It changes how you view someone.\"-Steve Lipson, SuperDeluxeEdition, March 2017\n\nEventually McCartney reluctantly accepted most of the changes, and the sessions proceeded, although he considered remixing \u2018Figure Of Eight\u2019 before the album\u2019s release.\n\n\n\"He said, \u2018I always saw this as a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of track, like an old-fashioned rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u2019 and I said to him, \u2018Well that\u2019s great if you want to do it like that, but what I would suggest is you get on the phone and you get yourself some really good rock \u2018n\u2019 roll musicians because me and him don\u2019t like rock and roll, you know me and Steve, we just don\u2019t like it, we don\u2019t do it, so there\u2019s three of us, so you\u2019re kind of outnumbered on this one\u2019. He took it \u2013 that\u2019s what I liked about him, you see, because he took it really well. He said, \u2018All right, I get what you mean\u2019. Because I wasn\u2019t kidding, I wasn\u2019t being awkward or anything. To me it was 1988, so going \u2018do, do, do, do\u2019 didn\u2019t seem like a good idea. I remember he said, \u2018Let me understand what you\u2019ve done\u2019. So we spent a while and he got the chords into his head that we\u2019d come up with and he changed a couple of them and then we finished the track. But he was never totally happy with that track, Figure of Eight.\n\n\nI didn\u2019t know what he wanted from that track and I thought that where we\u2019d got to with it, in two days, was really good. I didn\u2019t think if we spent another week it would be any better and I didn\u2019t know if, in the end, the version that he came up with [with Chris Hughes] was any better than the version that we did.\n\nIt was something he was looking for that he didn\u2019t find and I didn\u2019t want to go back to it. They sent it over to us at one point and said, \u2018Do you think you could do a better mix of this?\u2019 But I listened to it and I listened to the mix that we\u2019d done of it and I didn\u2019t think we could. We could do a\u00a0different\u00a0mix, but sometimes when you\u2019re up against it \u2013 when we mixed it, we were up against it time-wise \u2013 you come out with a better mix and you go back and you\u2019ve got loads of time and you go up your own backside, so I didn\u2019t want to go there.\"-Trevor Horn, SuperDeluxeEdition, March 2017\n\nMcCartney evidently remained unhappy with the first version of \u2018Figure Of Eight\u2019. In February 1989 he re-recorded it with the members of his live band. The remake was produced by Chris Hughes.\n\n\"Paul played it to me, and I thought it was okay, although I couldn\u2019t really hear the Trevor [in it]. It may have bugged him slightly that I didn\u2019t go, \u2018wow, great, important track on the album, fantastic.\u2019 Then later, I think probably when we were finishing up \u2018Motor of Love\u2019, he said, \u2018you know, \u2018Figure of Eight\u2019, what do you think?\u2019 I said, \u2018to be honest, probably the song with a bit of work could be better than the version that you\u2019ve done.\u2019 He said, \u2018well, yes, maybe that\u2019s right.\u2019\n\nI didn\u2019t know that it was rock \u2018n\u2019 roll to start with. I had no idea Trevor had done such a good job. I said, \u2018it doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s got quite the vitality. It\u2019s not as vital as it should be. More band-like, more poppy\u2019. I think he liked the idea of it being more band-like than what he ordinarily does. Then he called and said, \u2018do you fancy having another go at it?\u2019 And that was it. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll give it a go. How far it gets moved from what it is, or whether it just needs a bit of energy in it, I don\u2019t know, we can try it.'\n\nSo we did sessions on that track. I think halfway through doing it, he said, \u2018I\u2019m really liking this, this could be a single\u2019. And that was it. At that point I wasn\u2019t going to go, \u2018yes, it\u2019s got to be a single Paul.\u2019 I didn\u2019t play it up. I got on with it, really.\"- Chris Hughes, SuperDeluxeEdition, March 2017\n\nHughes\u2019s version was mixed by Bob Clearmountain for single release. At 5:13, the final mix lasted nearly two minutes longer than the 3:27 album version.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know why Bob Clearmountain remixed the single version of \u2018Figure of Eight\u2019. I think \u2018Motor of Love\u2019 went through some mixes and remixes too. I think Paul mentioned a few times that he was very aware that Neil Dorfsman was American. I think there was some sense of it sounding a bit more American, or something\u2026\"-Chris Hughes, SuperDeluxeEdition, March 2017\n\nA video for \u2018Figure Of Eight\u2019, directed by Andy Morahan, contained footage from McCartney\u2019s concert at the Hallenstadion in Zurich on 29 October 1989.\n\n\n'Figure Of Eight\u2019 was released as a single on 13 November 1989. The 7\u2033 vinyl and cassette editions both had \u2018Figure Of Eight\u2019 (7\u2033 Mix), and\u00a0\u2018Ou Est Le Soleil?\u2019\u00a0on the b-side.\n\nThere were a number of other formats. One 12\u2033 vinyl single contained \u2018Figure Of Eight\u2019 (12\u2033 Mix) and\u00a0\u2018This One\u2019\u00a0(Club Lovejoys Mix), while another, released a week later, had \u2018Figure Of Eight\u2019 (12\u2033 Mix), \u2018Ou Est Le Soleil?\u2019 (Shep Pettibone remix), and \u2018Ou Est Le Soleil?\u2019 (Tub Dub mix by Shep Pettibone).\n\n\nThere were also two CD singles. The first had \u2018Figure Of Eight\u2019 (12\u2033 mix), a re-recording of\u00a0\u2018The Long And Winding Road\u2019, and\u00a0\u2018Loveliest Thing\u2019, an unreleased track from June 1987.\n\nThe other CD single, a 3\u2033, contained \u2018Figure Of Eight\u2019 (7\u2033 Mix), \u2018Rough Ride\u2019, and \u2018Ou Est Le Soleil?\u2019 (7\u2033 Mix). The two CD singles were also collected as a limited edition double pack.\n\nDespite the multiple formats, the single was not a commercial success. It peaked at number 42 in the official UK singles chart, and 92 on the US\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Hot 100.\n\n\n'Figure Of Eight\u2019 was the opening song performed throughout Paul McCartney\u2019s 1989\u20131990 World Tour.\n\nA recording from Rotterdam\u2019s Ahoy Sportpaleis on 10 November 1989 appeared on the live album\u00a0Tripping The Live Fantastic.\n\n[STUDIO VERSION](https://youtu.be/aVik87zUZEc?si=5azUOh1kaZhJK9OG)\n\n\n\n\n1-4: Not good. Regularly skip.\n\n5: It\u2019s okay, but I might have to be in the right mood to listen to it.\n\n6: Slightly better than average. I won\u2019t skip it, but I wouldn\u2019t choose to put it on.\n\n7: This is a good song. I enjoy it quite a bit.\n\n8-9: Really enjoyable songs. I rank them pretty high overall.\n\n10: Masterpiece, magnum opus, or similar terminology.\n\nRating Results\n\n*McCartney 1* 7.20/10\n\n1.

        "selftext": "My husband won't let me go to his funeral if he was killed but this sucks (no one's heard from him). We were childhood best friends and \"dated\" 7th and 8th grade but he was my first boyfriend and we remained great friends afterwards.  We got back in touch and cleared up some stuff but the reason why my husband doesn't like him is because he wrote me a letter when he was in the military (overseas) and said if he would've known that I never cheated on him and it was a girl lying about it to date him that he wouldn't have broken up with me and still would've dated throughout highschool and that his biggest regret in life was letting me go. Mind you my husband and I have a 6 year age gap and I started dating my husband when I was 18. So my husband demanded I never talked to my ex  again but my ex never got married or had any kids. Remained single majority of his life. \nMy sister told my husband this ex of mine keeps old photos of us and me while overseas which I understand is inappropriate but we were best friends and I really want to pay my respects to him. I used to swim with him, our group of friends, and his dad. We spent so much time together and  he used to say things like he will be uncle Ishmael  (to mine and my husband's kids) and I'd always say just wait till you have kids and I'll be auntie Z. It just hurts so much that everyone i hold dear and love are leaving forever and I can never say goodbye. Regardless of the feelings he was there after I was rescued from a trafficking thing, he was there through my courts, when I was a mess and self harming and trying to kill myself bc of the trafficking he held me together.  We were best friends and he was there through my darkest moments. My husband has seen the healed parts of myself but the last person left in this world to see me at my darkest and rawest self is now more than likely dead. The next time I get to see him is when I die too. I'm just so broken right now and I can't tell anyone this most certainly not my husband. ",

My dad lost all his money in his construction material supply business, and I'm currently working a job that pays only $800 a month. On top of that, I have student loans to manage.\n\nRight now, we are burdened with $250,000 in total debt and have lost all our savings. Every day feels overwhelming, and I've been struggling with my mental health, including having suicidal thoughts.\n\nI'm hoping to find some guidance or assistance from this community. If anyone has advice on how to navigate this situation or knows of resources that could help, I would greatly appreciate it. Additionally, if anyone is in a position to help with even a few dollars, it would mean the world to us during this challenging time.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.\n\nBest regards.  \n",

        "selftext": "Hello,\nThis is a statistics question. Many gamers think the average KD ratio is slightly less than 1.0 (suicides count as deaths but not kills).  The logic is that for each kill, there is one death. However, this isn't the case.\n\nAn extremely simplified version is this. Team A has Matthew and Mark. Team B has Luke and John. Matthew gets 12 kills and 10 deaths. Mark gets 3 kills and 4 deaths. Luke gets 3 kills and 5 deaths. John gets 11 kills and 10 deaths. The KD ratios are:\n\nMatthew: 1.2\n\nMark: 0.75\n\nLuke: 0.6\n\nJohn: 1.1\n\nTeam A has a combined 15 kills (12+3) and 14 (10+4) deaths. Team B has a combined 14 kills (3+11) and 15 (5+10) deaths.\n\nThe average KD ratio is therefore 0.91, not 0.99 to 1.0 like most believe. I have a super hard time explaining this to people who think \"wELL fOR EacH kiLl tHeIR sHOUld bE oNe deAtH , sO oBVIoUslY tHe kD rAtIO iS 1.0 oR aT lEASt cLosE tO 1.0 wItH sUICidEs!\" Heck, many game developers release data all the time showing an average KD ratio well under 1.0, yet this \"1.0 average\" myth persists.\n\nHow can I explain this in a way that's easy to understand? My above example is too complicated.\n\nEdit: A 1.0 KD ratio is very good. If you have a 1.0 KD ratio, be proud of yourself for understanding the game.",

        "selftext": "I had a horrible childhood/home life. Addict parents and no support system. I was miserably depressed and suicidal. When 7th grade came around I completely stopped trying in school. My home life was so rough I couldn't sleep at night, couldn't focus in classes, had panic attacks every single day. I barely managed to pass 7th and 8th grade. I had always been smart and learning came so easy to me. But as soon as I fell behind in those critical middle school years, I felt I was doomed to fail. \n\nI attended 9th grade and failed almost every class. I thought online school was a better alternative for me but without proper tutoring and structure I fell even more behind. By 10th grade I decided to drop out. I felt it was too late for me. I chose to begin working instead as I had to financial support from either parent. I never learned algebra. I never learned biology. I never learned any middle or high school criteria. \n\nFrom the ages of 15-23 I did nothing but procrastinate. I watched my friends graduate and go to college. I worked odd jobs. Any time I considered getting my GED I immediately felt it was impossible with my education level. I was so depressed. I had no support. \n\n5 months ago I decided it was time to stop procrastinating. It was time to start taking my education seriously. Self doubt held me back for too many years and I needed to take control. I always wanted to work in healthcare since I was 8 years old. I was finally ready to try to make my dreams come true. \n\nI bought a Kaplan GED book, some notebooks, pens, a whiteboard, and I WENT TO WORK. I studied 6 hours every single day. I read the pages and did the practice exercises over and over again until I aced them. I watched getsummath and other wonderful online tutors. In 5 months I taught myself algebra and geometry. Biology, chemistry, and physics. Proper essay formatting. Civics, economics, and history. I worked my ass off and for the first time in 7 years I felt hope. \n\nToday, March 26th 2025, I graduated with my high school equivalency. I'm immensely proud of myself and want everyone to know that if I could do it, SO CAN YOU!!! \n\nIn 5 more months I will be attending my first year of college to pursue a bachelor's degree in nursing. And in 5 years I will be a registered nurse with a college degree. Maybe 5 will be my new lucky number. \n\nBELIEVE IN YOURSELF. YOU CAN DO IT!!! \ud83d\udc9d",

        "selftext": "[A Libertarian Tolerance Test](https://c4ss.org/content/3614)\n\n>1. Would you be comfortable living in a society where cannibalism was practiced? I exclude the eating of murder victims by their murderers from this question. But it would include the eating of murder victims by third parties when their families sold the bodies to restaurants, children & teens killed in automobile accidents, suicides, prisoners executed for murder, and \u2014 soon available on eBay \u2014 celebrities who die from overdoses of drugs.\n\n>2. How would you get along in a society in which undergarments commonly substituted for bathrooms, so that it would be a common occurrence to be sitting in a restaurant or movie theater \u2014 or walking through a shopping mall \u2014 within a few feet of someone freely & unabashedly defecating or urinating under their clothing?\n\n>3. Professor Arnold van Huis of Holland\u2019s Wageningen University has written a white paper for the United Nations in which he suggests replacing the Western diet\u2019s reliance on red meat for protein with insects. How would you feel if his suggestion were commonly adopted & KFC served Kentucky Fried Cockroach? Let\u2019s up the ante. What if restaurants had bullshit burgers on the menu?\n\n>4. Combat to the death was popular in ancient times; the custom of dueling made it to the 19th century in America & later elsewhere. The Romans explored just about every variety of this, including combat between gladiators, human bouts with wild animals, and even filling an arena with water & staging ship battles. Would you have any problem with this as popular sports \u2014 and new variations, such as two skydivers fighting over one parachute \u2014 if all athletes were volunteers?\n\n>5. For much of human history human childhood ended at the onset of puberty. Could you live in a society where 11-year-old girls & 13-year-old boys could marry, work, smoke (including tobacco, marijuana, and opium), drink, consent to sex, gamble, and engage in prostitution in which they got to keep the earnings?\n\n>6. Do you believe people have the right to decorate, accessorize, or configure their bodies in any way they desire? Suppose tattooing & piercing were one-upped by \u201camping\u201d \u2014 the deliberate amputation of body parts \u2014 or blinding \u2014 people deliberately deciding to remove their eyeballs?\n\n>7. Here\u2019s a question about practices which are already not uncommon throughout Europe & Asia: public offerings of nudity & sex? Do you have a problem with X-rated sex-fetish movies on broadcast television; billboards with both male & female full-frontal nudity; nude beaches; topless women on sidewalks; couples having sex in public parks; red-light districts with prostitutes offering their sexual services to the street; clubs with orgies & human-animal sex shows?\n\n>8. A federal judge has just [2010] overturned California\u2019s Proposition 8, which had restricted marriage to a man & a woman. Do you accept that any form of marriage should now be legal, that California county clerks should now issue marriage licenses for unions including any number of men and/or women within a single marriage \u2014 and that these marriages should be able to have as many children \u2014 naturally, through surrogates, or through adoptions \u2014 as they desire?\n\n>9. Should any form of peaceful protest be allowed, not only burning of American flags, but including the defacement of religious icons \u2014 crucifixes, portraits of the Prophet Mohammad, Jewish Torahs?\n\n>10. Fox News commentator/comedian Greg Gutfeld has proposed the opening of a gay nightclub adjacent to the \u201cGround Zero Mosque.\u201d I\u2019ve already watched a documentary about a pro-life center operating across the street from an abortion clinic. Do you believe White Supremacists should be able to open offices next to NAACP centers, and that Neo-Nazis should be able to operate offices next to Jewish Synagogues?\n\n\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1jkrl4z)",

But well, since I actually now *want* to live for the first time in forever, I\u2019m kinda more thinking about how to get better. Thinking about trying to go to therapy again (was discharged two years ago because my therapist told me he didn\u2019t know how to help me so couldn\u2019t justify spending any more NHS resources on me when there was no indication I would improve), but I\u2019m scared that actually opening up about my feelings would lead to me being put in an inpatient facility.

Should I just try to go with a symmetrical option instead? The rest of our place is styled mostly MCM, not traditional.\n\n\\*\\*pls ignore difference in colour in #2 I just had to splice together different photos\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*storage / cost isn't a deciding issue as every combination is a similar price and happy with amount in storage in all of them\\*\\*\\*\n\nThank-you so much in advance, I've been spiraling into a pit of despair and indecision over this :\\*)))))\n\n  \n",

        "selftext": "*I have debated on how to write this for a long time now and I figured I should just do it. So I apologize if it's kind of long or just a stream-of-thought kind of mess (I will do my best to organize it though).*\n\nI honestly don't know what to do anymore. I turned 40 the end of last year and I am struggling to keep going. I am depressed and suicidal, though I have been since I was a teenager. ***I am in no immediate danger of suicide***; I couldn't ever do that to my mom, she is the only reason I am still here. Doesn't change the fact that I cry myself to sleep every night thinking of it though.\n\nA little back-story. I grew up with a fairly normal family in a small rural town, and have 3 siblings; 1 sister, and 2 brothers. We were all homeschooled growing up because my mom was not a fan of the public school system and had her masters in education so she taught us. Even though we were homeschooled, we weren't socially isolated. We did sports (soccer, karate, football, paintball, etc.), as well as attending groups with other kids. My parents got divorced when I was about 12 and all my siblings and I stayed with my mom and she continued to homeschool us while working full time. I always had an *extremely* difficult time making friends, which I attributed to being homeschooled. But some of my siblings did just fine making friends when they were kids and into adulthood. My sister had many friends growing up, then struggled with self-esteem but is now engaged. My 2 brothers are doing well also, one is married with 5 kids, the other is in a relationship and is a complete extrovert but also extremely popular (the kind of person everyone likes and is everyone's friend). \n\nUnfortunately however I have been pretty much alone my entire life. I had 2 friends who lived on our street when I was about 8, they were brothers, but that friendship only lasted about a year (don't remember what ended it). I didn't make any other friends until I was 19. I had been going to a youth group at my church to try and make friends for over 2 months with not so much as someone's phone number. Finally one night after another unsuccessful youth group after everyone was gone I went to talk to the youth pastor, I couldn't stop crying and I was trying to ask him how do I make friends? His response was just talk to people and making friends is easy (if only). The next Sunday before church I had 2 of the guys there ask if I wanted to play some basketball and we ended up becoming friends; I honestly think the youth pastor talked to them, as they had never talked to me in the previous 2 months. That friendship also only lasted around a year before they moved away. After that I came to terms with the fact that I was gay (I had known I was attracted to guys since I was 13-14, but didn't really accept it). The only other \"relationship\" I had was a \"romantic relationship\" in my mid 20's, I thought I had found someone, but it turns out he didn't give a shit about me, they just wanted to use me for my money. They Iwere horribly abusive and were constantly using drugs/alcohol. The only kiss I've ever had is a peck on the lips from him (never did a deep kiss or make out, he said people only do that on tv or in junior high. As soon as I started school and stopped working I had little/no money, so he said he's moving in with someone he met on Grindr.\n\nIt's not like growing up I didn't have contact with people. Sure I wasn't in public school, but we did a lot of after school stuff. I got a job at 16, worked at Walmart for 4 years. After that I went to college, I went to 3 different colleges and ended up with 4 different degrees (couldn't decide on what I wanted to do). Went to work straight out of college and have been working full-time since. And in all of that, with all the social contact I still never made any friends. The whole time I had assumed my social problems had come from being homeschooled, however it wasn't until my early 30's when I learned I had Asperger's/autism. Had my GP doctor send me to see a specialist and after a few visits and a lot of tests I was diagnosed with autism. \n\nI always knew my life was kind of pointless and meaningless, but there was always the hope I would get better socially, and my problems would get better as I got older. Especially after the diagnosis, I hoped that would help me understand my problems better and be able to connect with people. But here I am at 40 years old and nothing has changed. I still have no friends, no relationship, no kids. The only person I have in my life right now is my mom. She is living with me and has been since I was 30, I am taking care of her since she has had multiple hip and knee replacements, and has bad mobility problems. But I'm starting to realize that there is really no point to me living other than my mom, she would be the only person that would really care. My Grandparents and my dad have all passed away, and I don't see my siblings all that often since they live a good distance away.\n\nIt all really sucks, I hate the way my life is... I want a family and kids so bad. I'm a Christian, so I'm not supposed to be gay and marry another guy. But I'm also not attracted to women (*I wish I was),* it would make it easier to have a family. Although even if I was, I am still autistic and fucked up. If I can't even make a friend, the chances of a romantic relationship are practically non-existent. And I know I could adopt, but I am not going to screw up a kid that badly (single autistic parent with no social skills).\n\nI'm sorry for this long mess. I have just been sitting on this for a long time and have nobody else to tell it to. I just need to get it out and vent whether someone reads it or not.",

My face is really uniquely shaped and I'm just all an all an ugly guy and she thinks she's the same but she's not she calls herself fat when she's just perfect for her height nothing wrong with a little tummy but otherwise she's skinny in my eyes and the fact she doesn't believe anything anyone says that's positive but anyway let's get into other concerns/anxious feelings I have we met in college and were still in college now but we connected through playing overwatch together now we don't do that much often as we did  little while ago but now we also don't do the cute/close things we did which I adored like staying up on calls together sleep calls and face timing (we didn't face time much) but I don't know how to express any of these feelings to her because I fear me sharing my feelings of suicide and self harm has driven her away a little and it's killing me genuinely but I have possibly the best news I can bring myself and it's that she's asked me out to go ice skating (not as a date) and at least I know she wants to see me but apart of me makes me think its her being nice after dealing with my vents and shitty health but then again I think she's to nice to do that but overthinker will overthink I love this girl so much it's crazy I'm 18 and she's my first ever real crush not like a celebrity or a pretty girl on TikTok crush my first REAL love crush and I don't want to Ruin it by asking her to be my first love because she's had bad partners in the past so I don't want her to feel pressured into saying yes but I also can't stand bottling these feelings because I scare myself with the negative thoughts and feelings of her not liking me I just wish I could ask her but it's simply isn't possible for me as I'm autistic, ADHD and social anxious but she's brought me out my shell I brought her out her shell and people already assume where dating because of how close of Friends we are in public and we trust eachother with everything (even the most embarrassing things about each other I. E insecurities, past, trauma an the fact she feels comfortable to even be in places 2 people of opposite sex don't usually go together (we hid in a toilet stall together) so I know if she trusts me this much theres a chance she doesn't fear / feel a need to say yes to me out of fear or anxiety of peer pressure and then there comes the other issues of our intellectual differences she's so amazingly smart she didn't even do high school (I did) and she smashed her GCSE papers (I didn't get to do them) and shes way smarter than Me and I feel 2 very different people one with a future (her) and me (no future at all) could ever work out in the future if we are to somehow get together this whole situation of anxiety and fear is drowning me because I feel cruel to myself and also her because I think I'm making it obvious but she isn't picking up on it or shes missing the signals I just wish she would make the first move on me so my feelings can be washed away but I don't think this will ever happen because she's to good for me in every way possible but I also think she isn't the type to confess Because she herself is autistic and I love her so much but I don't know what I'm going to do I need to man up and stop being so anxious and get out of my silent teenager stage because if I have a chance at her I'm throwing it away but at least all is not lost as she also mentioned coming to my house (she's been there once before to meet my mom when we were hanging out) in September so we can hang out and she can chill with me and play games with me in person (aka she doesn't have a pc and loves Valorant and wants me to teach her how to play) I will update this post whenever I do it however long that may take....

        "selftext": "Problem/Goal: i have this goal na matagal ko ng pangarap way back 2013. Isinantabi ko yun para sa mga mas important na bagay like bahay at lupa kasi nga yearly nag mamahal (ayaw ko makitira at ng extended family). From 2013 up to now nag mamanifest yung feeling of hopelessness about sa goal na to kung Kailan ko ba makukuha.\n\n  \nContext: Im 35 years old and 6 years na kaming married with 1 kid. Mahal ko sila pero nakakaramdam ako ng pagod. Ako yung breadwinner samin and pnrovide ko sakanila lahat ng pwede ko ibigay para maging comfortable sila.\n\nPrior ipinganak yung anak namin nag resign sya sa work and primary reason is power tripping and para makapag focus sa anak namin. Nag ask sya sa akin ng capital para makapag small business sya online ang ending naluma sa sulok yung mga paninda. Next naman nag ask sya ng oven, equipments and paid online lessons kasi gusto nya daw matuto mag bake and para makapag tinda sya, ang ending natuto lang sya mag bake pero di sya active nag ssell.\n\nMinsan pag nag mamanifest yung despair and inoopen ko sakanya, nag ttry sya mag effort mag hanap ng source of income for a few days pero walang nang yayari. Nakaka frustrate kasi parang puro simula lang sya tapos walang follow through. Sinuportahan mo sa path ng pagiging self employed pero mag hahanap ng ibang gagawin. Mga ilang beses na namin pinag awayan ito ang ending lumalamig n lang yung issue which is nakaka sawa na.\n\nAng hirap kasi parang mag isa lang ako sa finances. Minsan naiiyak ako. Meron naman naitatabi most of the time around 20k a month(not sure if enough yung ganito para sa family setup) pero alam mong hindi mo dapat galawin (Feeling ko nag kaka depression na ako). Bago pa ako maka bili ng big purchases may mga bagong gamit or bayarin ako kailangan bayaran or iprovide kaya ang ending sapat lang na pag ssave yung nagagawa ko pero not enough to pursue that goal.\n\nLagi n lang grocery, utility bills, monthly tuition hindi pa kasama yung mga malalaking bayarin every year like initial enrollment fee, vaccine, insurance, amilyar, registration na sasakyan. Papano n lang pag matatanda n kami? Kung ganito sya baka sa kangkungan kami mapuntang dalawa.\n\nSobrang pinag sisipagan ko yung trabaho ko pero hindi ko alam kung hangang anong level ng hardwork or ilang promotion ba yung kailangan ko makuha to achieve financial goals. After promotion back to zero ulit tapos mas mataas na bundok yung aakyatin na walang guarantee kung maakyat mo ba talaga.\n\nIm already at my boiling point and ayoko gumawa ng drastic decisions. Honestly hindi ko alam na may ganitong trait sya na parang passive parati and walang urge to aim higher.. I always pray na makita nya yung gusto nyang gawin para may leeway kami para sa mga goal that will make us feel alive.\n\nSa sobrang nakaka sawa iopen skanya itong issue na ito isinulat ko n lang sa notebook yung mga thoughts ko habang ginagawa itong post na to. Ang hirap makatulog pag ganito yung pakiramdam. Bukas iiwan ko n lang ito sa lamesa ko baka sakaling mabasa nya pag nasa office ako bukas. :(\n\n**Bawal pala image pero ito ang mga nakalagay sa notebook ko**\n\n***- im frustrated***\n\n***-holding into goal for over a decade and feeling stuck is frustrating.***\n\n***-Doing my best to provide but not enough.***\n\n***-Balancing the budget while chasing the goal makes me feel it's out of reach. (Baka wala na ako sa earth nun)***\n\n***-Working everyday for 11 hours. How can I earn more?***\n\n***-Before I can buy, there's a constant cycle of expenses that I need to consider making me feel never getting ahead and it's very exhausting.***\n\n***-That's a lot to carry(long hours of work, doing all possible opportunities and dealing with the frustrations)***\n\n***-I want to see same level of grit***\n\n***-I want to see good level of drive.***\n\n***-I don't feel our goals are align***\n\n***-Supported to path of self employment but considering something else. (I really want to see a firm plan!)***\n\n***-Invested on those dreams only to see them shift without real progress.***\n\n***-Breaking point***",

        "selftext": "Hello, so I am Mexican, I'm 17y/o and of course I'm getting closer to being a high school graduate and I've just been thinking about working as a medical interpreter, although I wouldn't mind working on other fields, but something I'm still unsure about is the salary, not because I want to chase money, however, you... need money to be able to have a comfortable life \n\nSo my main question is, what's the highest amount of money you could get paid as a remote interpreter living in Mexico? Do the salaries change much if i continue to get degrees in the field? Is there a brick wall at some point? \n\n\nI'd be quite happy if someone is able to assure me I can get something up to +20,000mxn a month but again I'm ignorant when it comes to jobs so that's why I'm asking. \nAnd, well this has been wandering in my head since I'm almost 18, need to support my family and would like to pursue a career (which I'd pay for working at a call center or if i get trained as an interpreter without a degree) and I really want this plan to work out, cause uhm... I can't really leave my state now, firstly I would not even be able to pay for college and rent by myself, and It'd be hard to get a normal big kid job to pay for college cause my legs are fucked lol I've had 5+ surgeries so they'd look at me having some trouble walking and be like \"we'd rather hire someone else\" but hey i happened to learn English in my teenage years so I'm not hopeless \ud83d\uddff\n\n\nso that's pretty much it!

        "selftext": "I just want to say thank you to this sub, I am just over 5 weeks without social media on my phone. After years of uninstalling then reinstalling social media apps, this is the longest I have ever lasted and I am feeling so much better!! In those 5 weeks I did reinstall TikTok to delete my account after like 6 years, and I have deleted my Instagram accounts too. I have uninstalled the Reddit app, but when I am struggling I have googled and read so many threads on this sub that have inspired me to keep going. I would have upvoted or replied to those comments but I haven't been logged in to Reddit and didn't want to do that. This sub has provided me with a sense of not being alone in my struggles, and the nosurf activities list has been super helpful! I am logging out after I post this but I just wanted to thank those that have successfully reduced or eliminated social media in their lives and shared HOW they did it. I knew WHY I wanted to do it, but doing it was a struggle.\n\nYes I recognise the irony of logging in to Reddit to post this on a social media platform. While I recognise the harms of social media/being online, I still think that the internet is an amazing way for people to share experiences and information - it seems to depend more on how we, as individuals, take in/use this information. \n\nBriefly want to share my experience so far: I have experienced new levels of boredom, loneliness, and emptiness since deleting social media on 17/02. However, I have now read a few books, started crocheting and have spent more time with family and outdoors too. I have complex MH issues that I knew were exacerbated by social media but I didn't realise *how much it impacted me* and the more insidious effects social media was having on me. I was constantly subject to inflammatory content, constantly being sold products/lifestyles, and my attention span was (still is) absolutely shit. Not to mention the frustration and hopelessness I would constantly feel from being constantly inundated with political content, and the comments of misinformed people that made me feel like not only are our world leaders stupid, but your average civilian was just as stupid. This contributed majorly to my constant anxiety, racing thoughts, and sense of doom. I have difficulty sleeping and wake up around 2-3am every day, and by sunrise I was depressed and couldn't shake it. The tipping point was when I went on TikTok to distract myself after a nightmare and found myself googling and genuinely taking notes on how to survive a nuclear war.. \n\nMy experience is just my experience, but I really wanted to say thank you to those that share their success story and how they achieved it. In particular I realised how toxic TikTok was for me after uninstalling the app for 3 weeks, and I wanted to delete my account but wasn't sure. I found a post on this sub where people shared their personal experience of deleting their accounts and it inspired me to delete mine and I will never look back. Sorry if this is long, I'm on safari on my mobile and it's very hard to navigate (which is a deterrent I appreciate). ",

So that we can enjoy the rest of our days. \n\nI believe in my heart that we will over come. I do believe in miracles.  I believe that this is the beginning of our new journey. Even still. I am pro active as we have a young child. \n\nThis is not easy for anyone. My Son is a Superstar athlete. But still in the developmental years. \n\nI have to be strong for all of us. And I am for the most part. \n\nBut I really wanted to speak with someone. Anyone. And my family is absent emotionally from this situation. \n\nAs I write. My tears flow. Non stop. \n\nI am grateful to have found a forum to express my self. \n\n\nI am here for anyone who just wants to talk. You can all find me on here. I will document my progress and everything through out; our process. \n\n\n\nWe are making arrangements to reunite in Heaven. \n\nThis is one of the rarerest of the 80 or so types of this. This only has made everything worse. \n\nI am already gone. What is left of me is the bare minimum. \n\nI plan to have surgery myself and continue to be there for my Son. I realized. He is all that we have. And the only reason to go on. \n\n\nI am not afraid of death. My wife is not either. We believe in God. We believe in heaven. As a human being. I can't help but to suffer. \n\n\nEvery second I die all over again. I have the most different dreams. At night. Is the worst. \n\nIt took everything to write this publicly. But its part of the healing process. \n\nThis may help a family in need. Even is just to speak with someone. \n\n\nI needed a place to cry. \n\nYou are all welcome to join me. But I also want to document the better days. \n\n\nI plan to travel with my family as much as possible. During the following years. I read about a person who went on to survive another 22 years! \n\n\nThere are small hopes. And that is good enough for us. We could have months. We may have years left. Either way. We will live each day as it is our last. \n\nI love you all. Even in my deepest pain. My heart is capable of love. I share this with you all. \n\n\nGod bless you all for passing by here. I will be here through this entire process. \n\n\nMy heart goes out to the Universe for all Eternity. Love is the most powerful thing that we have. Use your love to navigate moments like this. \n\n\n\nThis is my childhood sweetheart heart. My wife of over 25 years. My entire Universe. \n\nThe person I used to be is no longer alive. Only my love continues to forever fight. \n\n\nGod bless you all. \n\n\nOnce you find true love. Love that person forever. It truly is once in a lifetime. I have been with my Wife since the first day we met. \n\n\nIt has been truly, love at first sight. Every single day. \n\n\n\nI love her so much I want to die with her. \n\n\nMy Son keeps us grounded. \n\n\n\nHes still a baby. He needs me until he finds the love of his life and marries her. \n\n\nI am so destroyed inside. All I can do is pray and continue to love her forever. \n\n\n\nBeautiful love stories last forever. \n\n\nLove never dies. \n\n\nLove forever with all of your hearts. I finally learned that life is about love. \n\n\nNothing else matters. \n\n\nWhomever you love. Call them and write them and tell them right now. Tell those that you love how much you love them every day. \n\nLove is the key to life. \n\n\n\nThank you \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f",

Shit\u2019s  getting frustrating, and my brain has been entertaining ways to end it a bit too often lately.  So I\u2019m a 24 year old guy, and pretty much all my problems boil down to being/feeling ugly whenever I\u2019m not by myself.  It\u2019s pretty damn cringe, but it is what it is.  To make matters worse, the reason I became hyperaware/self-conscious of my physical appearance is that my older brother is pretty much the exact opposite.  Unfortunately, I\u2019m quite analytical (at least above average smart), and growing up I picked up on many comments/situations (with family or friends) that showed the differences between my brother and me.  He\u2019s had a few gfs and many other interested girls, and I, on the other hand, have felt hopeless from the start and have never even allowed myself to truly like a girl.  And I\u2019m at an age where I\u2019m thinking what I want my future to be.  And what I really really want is pretty much a family and a job that allows me to be a good father.  And obviously, I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s gonna happen if I can\u2019t get over myself.  And I\u2019m pretty convinced that if that dream dies in my 30s or 40s, I will absolutely kms.  I don\u2019t know, being ugly sucks just by itself, but growing up along someone who is attractive adds a special kind of sting to it \ud83d\ude02.  Anyway, I really really really love my brother thank god.  We are actually pretty close.  The point being that my feelings are not of anger or anything but more like just this general sadness and hopelessness.  I pretty much feel like there\u2019s a huge permanent shit stain and a spotlight on me whenever I\u2019m not in my bed reading or playing guitar by myself.  It\u2019s not completely hopeless.  I did manage to get a compsci degree from a pretty good university, I could not have asked for a better family to be born into, I have savings, I have other interests im good at like reading and music and chess.  I haven\u2019t been able to land a job with my degree pretty much because I suck at interviews (and you can guess why).  So I\u2019m also at a retail job I hate not because it\u2019s hard but becuse of the way I described I feel when I\u2019m not by myself.  It\u2019s also weird that my older coworkers asked me if I wanted to be set up with this girl (wayyyyyyyy outta my league) and they were obviously just trying to make me feel better.  \n\nOkay, so why tf do I wanna end it?  Pretty much I\u2019ve tried so many times to change \u2014 to \u201cput myself out there\u201d and explore new things and situations and that damn feeling i described is always there.  I always feel people are nice to me because of pity or that my attempts are all in vain becuase my fate was already set from when I was born.  I realize this is only my perception, but it does not change that sting in the heart when I get home from work or right before sleep.  And right there is where my suicide thoughts happen.  I always said to myself that i dont think i could ever really do it, but in not so sure now.  Maybe it\u2019s because 24 feels more serious.  Idk, someone who might have a helpful perspective please respond.",

The only reason I loved them then was because you're programmed from birth to love them for survival.\n\nMy parents are terrible people, self centred and immature. They were more interested in fighting with each other than caring for me. Almost every night between the ages of 8-14 they would scream at each other. They hated each other, I heard them one night in particular discussing that they \"had to stay together\" for me. I was a child so of course I blamed myself for their unhappiness.\n\nI remember being jealous of my friends with divorced parents because at least those parents had the chance to be happy, even if it wasn't a great outcome.\n\nAs I got older my parents stopped talking to each other entirely and would use me to communicate. As the only child I would have to listen to both my parents venting about the other one. I emotionally shut down and turned inwards. My friends described me as cold.\nI had a rough time in puberty and developed severe depression. I couldn't communicate with my parents and when I tried they would dismiss me. I began self harming as a way to show them how much pain I was in. If they ever noticed they didn't do anything to help. \n\nI finally realised they couldn't help me. I cried alone in my room and learnt to self soothe although I learnt lots of unhelpful coping strategies.\n\nAfter I turned 18 everything exploded. My mum cheated on my dad she had told me not to tell him. I had no idea what to do so I moved out of my childhood home. Dad found out and the seperation was messy and long. And ended in me having a shouting match at my dad. \n\nI'm in my late 20s now, I've had psych inpatient stays and multiple suicide attempts. I lost my job and had to turn to sex work to make ends meet because my mother was having a breakdown and my father told me to \"pull yourself up\" and refused to lend me a bit of money.\n\nIm coming to terms with how badly my parents failed me. And I understand they were struggling but to me that's not an excuse to neglect a child.\nI can't love them because I don't respect them. They blamed everyone else for their personal problems and never took ownership of their lives. I grew up without positive role models only people I didn't want to be like.\n\nI'm doing much better in life now, I have a career in science and a fantastic relationship and friends that I consider family.\nI have no need for my parents in my life and I don't love them so I really don't see the point in playing pretend around them. \nWhy the fuck should I care about them and their lives when they never gave a shit about mine?\nA horrible part of me wishes they would vanish from my life so I don't have to continue interacting with them. I've always been self sufficient and I'm a stronger person for it.\n\nThere's more to this story obviously but this post is long enough. Just had to get it out there.",

        "selftext": "I was watching a show to distract myself . I can feel that it will be hard day. A good distraction usually works . So I started watching the show, got to episode two and the main character said the following as a comedic bit\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 I see how you behave . You must have loving and nurturing parents that always wanted the best for you !!\u201d\n\nI heard that . And I am reminded my dad is dead. My mom is dying from dementia . She already forgot I was married . I will never get to tell her about my wife has died . After crying for a good 15 min. I decided to watch something more constructive. David Kessler videos . \n\n\u201cWhen a spouse dies\u201d and \u201cNavigating the river of grief\u201d\n\nIn the videos he was separating the event (fact) and the experience (story) .  The death of my wife is a fact. How I talk about it is the story . I am not the author of the facts. I am just the storyteller. I am only the author of the story.  That is the only part I can change . I can\u2019t change the facts. Any energy devoted to wishing the facts would change is not a good use of my time . The storytelling itself will shift how i feel about the event \n\nBut the kicker is the old wounds from our lives. Old wounds always demand to be heard . Especially the ones that were never healed . It will color  how we tell our story .  And for me, it was my parents . Those wounds have not , and probably is unlikely to be fully healed . It is casting a shadow on how I tell my story about my wife\u2019s death \n\nDavid Kessler then talked about healing . Healing, not in the sense that things are better and there is no pain. Healing \u2014 in the sense that the event no longer controls me. I will still feel the pain but it does not run my life. The pain being a direct reflection of how much I love her . Healing means , I no longer have to make decisions in my waking hours based on the event and her death\n\nI think this is something I can work with. A state of being where her death no longer runs my life . Of course he also talked about being alive after your spouse has died. Often times, we are not ready for feeling of disloyalty we have to be living again.  The compulsion of suicide is huge . Because we want to spend the last minute together with our spouse . \n\nBut what we had was our vow.  Till death do us part. She died. When I continue to live , I am not disloyal to her . Nor will the love stop. It is just that I am still here. Breathing . \n\nIf you are still reading . Thankyou for reading my long post . Wish you all a peaceful Thursday \n",

        "selftext": "i had many talking stages running before i started dating my girlfriend, i'd kill myself if we ever broke up, i'd never want to breach her trust, or make her upset, or cheat on her... but i did.\n\nAbout 4 days into the relationship i was cutting off these girls in talking stages, and one night while i was explaining that i entered a relationship this girl started asking for nudes, i said i was dating and it wouldn't be a good thing to do but she kept going till i eventually sent them, i should've blocked her. Before i even did the actual photo taking i felt the guilt, i cried for 3 hours till i fell asleep (this was after i sent it and blocked her).\n\nIts been months, i tried to forget and it mostly worked, but i overthink a lot about my girlfriends loyalty, her bodycount, if she loves me, etc, and i was worried about her cheating and the thought of \"how could you even blame her if she is when you did it yourself\" came up and i haven't been able to think since, i've just wanted to die, to disappear. She trusts me so much, she really does, and when i tell her this happened it'll destroy it all, i would be dead without her and she'd be dead without me - literally - i've helped her through many bad periods of her life in the short 3 months of dating together and she really trusts me and loves me, and i love her just as much back.\n\nI intend to tell her but i know that she'll likely break up with me, and even if she doesn't she'll never love me the same, i know it and feel it in my gut. I cannot bear losing her, i want to be her forever. I wanted to be the one who wouldn't cheat, i wanted to be the one who wasnt like the other guys... but here i am. I'm ready to die, i'm ready for existence to end, to take this dark secret to the grave. I'm not religious but if god exists then i'm going to hell and i completely deserve it, i just wish the pain thats been killing me this past week could actually end my life instead of just making me want to do so.\n\nI don't want to lose her, i want to make her life perfect, treat her right, make sure no one could ever hurt her, make sure she's ok forever. but i've failed before we've even been together that long. I didn't even want to do it but i was weak - i gave in to pressure - i shouldn't have done it. I've never done anything like that before and i wont ever again.\n\nHow do i fix it, can i even tell her? would it be best to just forget it? What do i do? How do i fix things for us like i usually fix things for her?\n\nI just don't know what to do to fix things when i tell her, or how to make things ok. I'm so lost i don't even know where to start.",

        "title": "What type would you consider this? (Questionnaire answered)",
        "selftext": "Ii am curious what my type might be. I have an idea but would like your input here as I am unfamiliar with the theories. I am 29 if that matters. I answered a questionnaire I found: \n\n\nL (logic)\n\n\u2022\t\u2060How much time and energy do you spend researching or studying? Do you like researching and studying, and why?\nI actually do like spending time researching and studying. the subjects I enjoyed during school and uni where those where either pure memory power was involved (I enjoy and am good at memorising large portions of information) and where creative brain power was involved (I enjoy a good math or physics question, or an open ended sociology related question\u2026 doesn\u2019t really matter what the subject is tbh)\n\n\u2022\t\u2060How many of your own opinions do you form? How often do you do actual thinking on your own, more than just finding an existing answer?\nI like to believe I form my own opinions easily and without issue. Although I am certain we\u2019re all influenced in some way through our thinking so it\u2019s kind of an existential question. Where do my own opinions start anyway? I tend to think of opinions and answers and try to verify these, or find reasons not to think that way (either is fine) \n\n\u2022\t\u2060How often do you talk about concepts or facts? Why exactly do you talk about it, and what do you like talking about most?\nI won\u2019t engage in a pure factually laden conversation. I rather speak in concepts, and then ponder about the facts that could back it up. I like to talk about the stuff that is still unexplored or unsure- like where does the universe begin/end? Very open ended. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060Do you struggle with thinking about things by yourself? Does this bother you, and how much? How well do you handle criticism from others when it comes to your logical concepts or factual knowledge?\nI don\u2019t struggle although I prefer an approach where multiple POVs are involved. I am biased and I like to have different POVs challenging the subject. I am not too keen on criticism out of criticism alone although if I feel the intent of the criticism is to find the truth behind it rather than \u201cI am more right than you\u201d I won\u2019t have any issues to accept and move on. I don\u2019t like it when things get personal in such scenario.\n \n\u2022\t\u2060Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?\nI did enjoy although I feel neutral? It\u2019s not boring but I feel like I\u2019ve been typing for too long lmao. \n\n\nE (emotion)\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Do you consider yourself a creative person? What do you do that's creative?\nYes I am. Creative in problem solving, art and spacious design. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060How do you feel about expressing your own emotions? Are emotions part of your decision-making at all? How much of a role do they play in your decisions?\nI do tend to wear my heart on my sleeve, however I do have a part of me that is \u201crestricted area\u201d. I am just really really good at hiding it. I decide with my emotions by large portion, yes. We only live once, I\u2019d rather feel good with a decision I make. It often intertwined with rationality too though. But the emotions have the VIP seat. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060How much effort do you put into creating a positive emotional influence on other people? Do you try to do this at all? Do you like exploring the emotions or creativity of others?\nEffort? None. But I have great effect on people by being a positivo myself thoug. I don\u2019t actively explore others emotions or creativity, only when I find it interesting at the given time. I do take interest in others but I am a bit of a pragmatic. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060Do you feel uncomfortable with the idea of sharing your emotions? Do you struggle with knowing exactly how to connect with others on a deeper and more emotional level? Do you struggle with knowing how to go about dealing with and handling your emotions?\nNo not uncomfortable. I wear most emotions on my sleeve but the hidden ones are kinda \u201crestricted area\u201d. I usually am unaware of those myself, or just don\u2019t understand the why behind them. This tends to be rarer though. I don\u2019t exactly struggle with handling them, but I tend to ignore them long enough for me to find it increasingly difficult to deal with them. It I do every time anyway. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?\nI found these more difficult to answer correctly than the first part, which made me liking to answer these I suppose. \n\n\nF (physics / foundation)\n\n\u2022\t\u2060How much time and energy do you put into your physical health? Do you try new healthcare or self-care products often? How often, and what kinds of products do you like trying?\nNot really. I take care of my health by doing the necessities. For work I need to look composed and professional so I do take care of myself for at least the bare minimum lmao. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060How much do you care about your physical appearance, including fashion choices, or decorating the physical environment for comfort? Do you like exploring the physical environment (food, nature, architecture, etc), or doing physical activity?\nI do care about physical appearance in a sense that me feeling good in my skin turns me into a person who loves herself a bit more. So I like to go for a run or spin, and buy timeless clothing that will fit me for a long time. I do enjoy skiing and taking in beautiful scenery. It grounds me because I tend to be swept up in my head constantly. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060Do you like talking about your personal tastes often? How often do you explore the personal tastes of others? What about your own health or the health of others? Do you like creating or exploring comfortable environments with others?\nTastes? What tastes lmao. I am a bit confused about this question to be fair. I suppose comfort is important and I am always piqued by the whys of people\u2019s tastes? \n\n\u2022\t\u2060Do you stress about what people will think regarding your personal tastes? Do you prefer to follow fashion trends in worry that people may judge your own style? Do you worry about being sick or in poor physical health often? Are you able to take criticism about your health, aesthetic choices, personal tastes, or physical appearance?\nNot at all. Neither of the mentioned questions are relatable to me. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?\nIt was a bit weird, not gonna lie. I suppose this one is gonna be on the lower end of the spectrum huh. \n\n\nV (volition)\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Do you know how to get what you want? How much effort do you put into figuring out how to get what you want? Do you just take action and get started, do you plan, do you research or try to get advice from others?\nI tend fo be good at getting what I want. I think on my feet and or plan ahead. Kinda depends on what is required. I do get info from everywhere, but I make my own conclusions. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060How often do you feel motivated to work on your future? How often are you busy working on a goal for the future? Do you prefer routine, or often fall into routine? Is your routine making progress on a goal? What makes you change your routine? What makes you start working on a goal?\nI am not so much of a routine goer. If I have set goals though, I am good at following routine if I can see the goal clearly (like with run training). But it requires great effort for me. I don\u2019t feel like I need to be conscious of my future constantly to be working towards my future, I have always done my life according to what I like and that turns out to go towards the goals I want. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060Do you like guiding or helping people reach their goals? What kinds of goals do you prefer to help people with? Are you a leader, or do you prefer to work in groups where you're an equal? How and when do you take charge, if ever?\nI do like to help people. I tend to be a bit of a teacher in this regard (I was an assistant at uni for two courses!). I tend to be good at leading although it\u2019s not something I would actively chase.  I rather have someone else take up the role and have me as their active advisor or something lol. I see people as equals. I don\u2019t feel better than any other and I think people shouldn\u2019t feel better than others either. I take charge quite naturally, usually by expressing my opinions clearly and by finding common ground in a group. I tend to be good diplomatically and assert myself clearly and without agressive dominance. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060Do you overwork yourself? Do you worry that you might be lazy or that you aren't progressing quickly enough? Does it feel impossible to find the right method forward? Are you able to take criticism over your choices for working towards your goals? How do you respond to being challenged?\nI am going to be honest, i don\u2019t respond all to well to the above. I can overwork myself yes. I sometimes think I am lazy although usually when I think this, it\u2019s true in that moment. I never feel hopeless to move forward though. I don\u2019t take criticism as well here. Sometimes I feel like people should leave me alone and let me do my thing to get to the point I want. That\u2019s just silly stubbornness and I know it\u2019s ricidulous and logically, I know I am being unreasonable. I value their input and so I should act like it. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?\nI did enjoy the above. Not boring at all and interesting topic. ",

        "selftext": "\nAfter many months of investigation a high profile criminal case it appears evident from court records that Pasadena gave a pedophile a \u201cbreak\u201d in order to falsely convict another man for a crime they conspired to entrap him in. (They refuse to provide the records of the pedophiles arrest blatantly refusing to comply with the Texas attorney generals ruling to release the records and only partially complying with other records request) \n\n\nCouncil meeting video https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lVgUl47AfFbJ5T5VCO_W52DQmqbPC_Gg/view?usp=drivesdk\n\nLink to February 18 council meeting https://youtu.be/kj85Hq08Ei0?si=ZtAME6RHsIlNa647\n\nLink to the certified complaint Pasadena claims doesn\u2019t exist as any case made by them. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/rTMfqJn\n\nThey refuse to release any record or acknowledge it exist. This pedophile will walk free after completing his probation of 6 years by the terms of his deferred adjudication in a few months. He served no jail time for sexually assaulting a 15 year old girl multiple times tried to \u201crape\u201d her and sent her photos of his penis according to CPS and Pasadena. They definitely used him to falsely convict the other man. As the other case was high profile and one of the first if it\u2019s kind spearheaded by the chief of major offenders Harris county prosecutor Samantha Knecht Why trade a known pedophile for a man you are coercing and entrapping into a crime ? Ridiculous\n\nMy 3 minute speech \n\nIf you recall, I spoke at last month\u2019s meeting on February 18th about my difficulty obtaining public records from Pasadena. refer to it on the Pasadena YouTube channel.\nThat night After I spoke, I noticed something at the front desk. I took a picture to confirm it, here it is \n It was my 2017 booking photo. Why was my photo posted before I had even come for the first time? \nThe only explanation is to obstruct me.\nFour days later, I confronted a staff member about it. He claimed he \u201cjust received it,\u201d but my photo proves that was a lie. You can see the video on my YouTube channel, D.O.G.E.E.G.O.D.\nSince then I have only received partial records as Pasadena refuses to comply with the ruling from the attorney general to disclose all records. Sotelo the records manager refuses to answer my calls.\nNow, Pasadena PD is denying the existence of criminal case numbers 1636576 and 1636577 regarding Edwin Kent\u2014even though I have the sworn complaint by officer brosas, certified by the district clerk.\nWhy deny this ?\nHere\u2019s what I believe:\n\t\u2022\tEdwin Kent sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl multiple times in a case so disturbing I cant stomach describing it.\n\t\u2022\tInstead of imprisoning him, Pasadena delayed his charges for years so they could use his testimony to entrap another man in a sting operation.\n\t\u2022\tPasadena refused to release all audio at trial. I obtained it, boosted and analyzed it\u2014there are no clear incriminating statements from the defendant, but signs of tampering, possibly using a technique called mixed pasting.\n\t\u2022\tIn exchange for his testimony, Kent received deferred adjudication\u2014meaning after six years of probation, he walks free.\n\t\u2022  a similar sting happened aftwerwards leading to Valerie McDaniel committing suicide by jumping off her balcony. Here\u2019s her \u201cdismissal\u201d \nPasadena is also refusing to release a call for service report from 3809 Meadow Lake Road despite the fact that it is referred to as an innocuous incident but the starting point for the sting operation at trial.\n\tfor 3809 meadow lake all I got was short dispatch log with little details but it is marked to have been edited years after the fact\u2014which is unnecessary unless to tamper with it. \n\t\u2022\tThe log also unlawfully redacts the names of regular officers, like Officer Riddings.\nHowever, along with investigative reports, this confirms that many people  not limited to officer MacGregor and Prosecutor Samantha Knecht committed perjury by claiming police responded October but this states November 7th.\nMacGregor also claimed Kent\u2019s involvement was limited to the initial tip, but his own report shows he tasked Kent with gathering covert audio.\nI believe the disturbance at 3809 Meadow Lake was when Pasadena PD discovered Kent was sexually abusing a child. Instead of stopping him, they tampered with the log and covered for him\u2014allowing him to help entrap another man. They could prove me wrong by releasing the details. \nwhat else could explain all this?\nDo the right thing admit your fault, your internal affairs officer Kenneth urban needs to stop delaying and investigate this. \nIf Pasadena PD refuses to be accountable, then it may be time to elevate this to state and federal authorities for further investigation.\nThank you.\n",

        "selftext": "Ever since I was little Ive bee  addicted to constantly living online. I've ruined so many of my relationships, discarded so many life altering opportunities, and socially ostracized myself completely from every community I've ever been in, all in the name of upholding my social media addiction. This sounds ridiculous. it's not heroin and it's not alcohol so it's not that serious, but it has genuinely ruined my life so much so that I'm happy for the brief moments my electricity goes out because I'm finally freed from these devices.\n\nI can't stop compulsively checking my phone and laptop. All I've been doing for the past nine years is ignoring my school work completely, sabotaging all of my friendships and totally cooping myself up in my room so that I can finally just be alone with my video games. I used to be such a dedicated artist back when I was little, and I still have slight talent for it, but I've given up all of my hobbies just because I can't pry myself off of social media.\n\nThis is all that my life has become. I live on the fucking line, I don't have any real social life out of this. Everyday I wake up, scroll through tiktok, chat with my friends online, play some games and sleep. My eating schedule is destroyed and I won't even talk about my sleeping habits because those are infinitely worse. I have no friends. I have zero social skills, I am extremely awkward and embarrassingly unhygienic. I rarely go to school and God forbid I ever do any type of homework because that's not happening.\n\nI bought a guitar last year and I really swore I was gonna dedicate myself to it. It's been in it's case for months now, untouched because I have other things to do -- like wasting time online for example. I don't have anything but my social media presence and I feel like I'd go crazy without it because if I ever was shut out of my virtual spaces I'd have nothing to look forward to in the real life.\n\nI've abandoned all of my hobbies. All I do is just watch youtube videos, at the very bare minimum write fictional works of my own and fluctuate between different friends online that barely mean anything to me. I've been doing this every single day for nine years straight. I am an educational failure and I'm considering dropping out. I'm never going to sustain a job due to a plethora of issues and the fact that I don't want to be separated from my devices.\n\nMy daily online screentime has been religiously above 11 hours for so long now that it's become expected. At minimum it's nine hours, at maximum it's been 16 hours or maybe even more. I've lost count because I just keep distracting myself with worthless things. I will never become anything special, I'm hopelessly addicted with no way out and I can't quit because I'd lose everything. I hate the outside world. I don't ever leave my house and I don't interact with anyone aside from my immediate family\n\nI'm a disappointment, practically a NEET and a worthless member to society. I will never efficiently contribute. I'm beyond saving.",

        "selftext": "Hi! I'm sorry if this will be a dumb question. I just genuinely face confusion and wonder if this is an odd experience- to put it into context- or try to make more sense of the matter, I tend to dissociate very heavily. Because of this.. I don't really feel my body as an attachment to me. That's why I might talk about it in a third point of view at times, it's because sadly I feel kind of detatched :(.\n\nI stopped being able to speak as a child. I remember the day it got bad kind of vividly. I got insanely afraid and so anxious in class presenting, that I could no longer speak. My voice would break apart and I got so afraid I started crying. I was in sixth grade at the time. \n\nAfter that, it would happen really often. I've always been a quiet person- because as a kid I was bullied, so much I never spoke to anyone. And over time it started to become harder and harder. I would feel so insanely scared of people and their judgement, I couldn't speak anymore.\n\nI stopped communicating to everyone and was terrified, and for the next 7 years now, I haven't spoke much at all. For some years I was entirely silent, and I physically couldn't speak anymore. Out of fear, anxiety and kind of hopelessness, my voice just didn't work. \n\nBut my voice works, after these years, only in certain times. I can't really speak of my own will :( or raise my voice. The only time my voice will make noise or speak, is when I'm under extreme pressure to talk,or feel like I'm being forced / watched heavily can speak only in small bits.. But never in a way that feels like a conscious choice. \n\nWith my brother, my voice will spill out like it's almost nothing, but sometimes it's whispery or really quiet, and sometimes when people really expect or push me to talk, I can.. In a scary silence, if I feel like people are judging me too much, it pops out now.. \n\nAnd for the past 5 years it never has. I assume I'm getting better somewhat but :( I don't know if that's a regular thing tied to my condition. 2 years ago I could only write, and now, my voice is only controlled by overstressing? I can speak small bits now if it gets bad enough, but when I do, people don't really believe me having dealt with it. \n\nI want people to understand that I try but I can't do much.. But they tend to only understand that I can speak quietly, so therefore expect me to say more or think I'm kind of being rude. I wish people could understand me kind of. I try to text people, because it's so much more fluid and easier,butt I think not many people want to do that or see me right. \n\nI saw someone for my selective mutism years ago. He said well, she's speaking just fine, just quietly. and he didn't help me with it, despite me writing him a note just to convey my feelings. Under the stress of the situation I was able to speak very quietly and I was shaking in fear, I told him yes and no. but he ended up not believing me. \n\nI'm just wondering, is this a regular experience? Is my anxiety too severe? :( i'm not sure how to feel about it much.",

        "selftext": "I made this account just to post this. I guess I wanted to throw this into the void, on the off chance someone might see it. I'm just so sick of being a teenager. There is truly nothing good about it (in my experience). \n\nIt feels like since turning, like, 12, I've had any morsels of self esteem I ever had be chipped down into nothing. I'm constantly scrutinizing every move I make, because it seems like everyone else is too.  Everyone around me is also insecure, but also selfish and self-serving, and constantly eager to take me down a notch (I'm sure I can be like this sometimes too). My friends have started abandoning me for their boyfriends/male attention, so I have gone from lonely to lonelier. And because I can't get any guys myself, I'm treated like a subordinate and a joke by my friends. I feel so ugly, like a literal disgusting ogre around my beautiful skinny friends. Being Indian right now really doesn't help either. I truly feel hideous every single day, and it seems like I am from the way I can't seem to get a single guy to even be interested in me. I feel so shallow for even caring about that, and I used to be so much more invested in more intellectual pursuits, but I feel like this is the only way I can prove I'm worth something. I'm aware of how messed up and abjectly pathetic that is. \n\nI also have basically no agency to do anything without my parents' permission (though they are usually pretty reasonable) and while this is obviously understandable, it is like adults completely forget what it is like to experience the maelstrom that is coming of age, and so inadvertently my parents tend to make my life exasperating. They are constantly nagging me about little things and it just wears down my self esteem more, making me feel genuinely like a worthless waste of space. I know they love me very very much, but now that I'm older (18), they are focusing more on their own lives and even as their only child  I sometimes feel like they stopped liking me a long time ago and only deal with me because they love me and I'm their child. I know this should be enough but for some reason it's not. I really feel like they don't like me the way they always yell at me and criticize me, even though its no where near that bad let alone abusive.\n\nI also just feel like adults constantly condescend to me, usually not purposefully, and tell me under thinly veiled phrases about needing to experience more of the world and being older that I don't know anything and will \"learn when you grow up\". It is invalidating without even trying to be. Everyone seems to chalk up your experience to \"hormones\", as if that dictates whether or not it is real and difficult and whether it warrants true sympathy and attention. It literally just makes me feel like an idiot for even opening up. \n\nAll of this stuff has just made me hate myself even more than I already do. I'm so tired of my friends, I'm so tired of my family, I'm so tired of being this person and living in this wicked world, where there is so much pain, strife, conflict, sadness, grief, etc. I hate myself for being so useless, stupid, ugly, and whatever else. I truly can't find a thing to like about myself. \n\nFor these reasons I'm so worried for the future. I'm scared I'm too ugly and unattractive to find love. I'm scared I'm too mediocre to be successful at my career; I want to be an academic or work for in policy or diplomatic relations. I'm not really charismatic or socially adept enough to thrive in any environment that requires it, which is like, every single one. My parents are quite old, and I have no siblings, and all except one of my grandparents is dead. I'm not close enough with my extended family because I live really far away from them all. My ultimate fear, which I feel with such lucidity and conviction will come true, is that my parents are going to die or become senile/mentally deteriorate, and I will have literally nobody. No partner, no strong friends (if this is how much people are prioritizing their partners in high school, how bad is it going to be when people settle down?), no one. I can see this coming true for me, because my entire life since I turned, like, 11, has been one step forward, four steps back in terms of mental health and feeling okay about myself. I truly feel so, so scared for the future and so completely alone. \n\nI'm sick of being humbled at every turn and always feeling down. I literally haven't felt truly happy in years. And all I hear from adults is that things only get worse, and that I should enjoy what I have. Truly, if this is what counts as \"the best time of my life\", I'm not ready to live longer than 25. I'm so done with being alive, everything is so tiring and I am constantly feeling judged or judging myself. I am tired of being myself. I am not >!suicidal!<, but I just can't keep doing this. Being a person is exhausting and I've only just begun my life. I'm not sure how much longer I can do this. For anyone who read this thing to the end, thank you. ",

Think of it like this, the pro choice movement just subjects women into a corner and makes them believe that the only way to handle their situation is to kill a baby. The pro choice community pretends like their aren't any other options (even though their are). So they can oppress women and keep them in the mindset of thinking that killing their baby is the only way to handle their situation if they can't financially or parentally keep the baby. Not to mention the women who have been forced to abort their children. Dr Anthony Levatino has worked with many high risk pregnancies and have concluded that terminating a baby because of the risk it has for the mother's safety is nearly unnecessary and unrealistic, sure some of those babies did require early births threw C-sections but it never lead to the mother's life in jeopardy. It pisses me off how so many mother's lost their babies because doctors immediately jumped to abortion without giving the babies life a chance unlike Dr. Anthony Levatino. Pro choice doctors and abortionist will see a women with a troubling pregnancy who still wants to keep the baby and tell her to terminate it anyway without offering those women all the best medical care possible (How is that NOT misogynistic?). So many mothers could be with their babies THAT THEY WANTED if it weren't for the misogyny in the pro choice movement. Restricting women from other medical or parenting treatments/options is pure misogyny. It's ironic how a movement made and called to give women more choices and options in their lives, turns out to be a misogynist in feminist clothing that takes women's rights to proper medical care and more. Not to note how abortions increase suicide, drug use, and risk of mental health development in women. Imo, if your a pro lifer, your a misogynist... PERIOD. To the female pro lifers reading (God bless you, your a slay Queen!!), I wanted to ask, what insights do you girls have that show the hidden misogyny in the pro choice movement and practice of abortion? I would appreciate your insight. ",

        "title": "Do I have panic disorder?",
        "selftext": "I've been convinced for years that I have some serious heart issues, but the problem is that despite a million tests I never have any problems.\n\nAbout 4 years ago I was diagnosed with a temporary heart condition from a reaction to a specific drug. I had a million tests done including electro's, echoes, and even a cardiac catheterization. They concluded that the condition would go away and no damage was done. All the tests said my heart looked fine.\n\nBut I've never felt fine. Since then I have developed new symptoms where my heart would randomly start beating extremely fast out of nowhere (like, I'll be sitting in my home watching youtube and it will go from normal to 150+bpm in literal seconds) for LONG periods of time (the most recent - 2 weeks ago - lasted for like 1-2 hours). And then I will feel negative symptoms for weeks after one of these \"attacks\"\n\nBut I've been to multiple cardiologists. I've had multiple ER visits.\n\nNothing, nada. They always tell me my heart is fine, other than elevated vitals. I've gone for years with suffering and no diagnosis, which has led to me losing my income and also having to move from my country of residence back to the united states.\n\nThere dilemma is that I don't know what's wrong or how to fix it. Some things I feel like could be explained with panic disorder, but others I can't explain. For example, it often affects me in my sleep and will wake me up. It also has affected my circulation and I get very cold often. But I'm wondering if maybe panic could cause the heart to race and then that might be causing side effects.\n\nI've felt hopeless for years but I've gotten a little hope that this might be a new avenue to pursue. But I don't know what to do\n\n**EDIT with details:**\n\nIt's something that has kind of evolved. It's something that kind of comes in waves over the period of weeks. So one week I will feel completely normal. But then I will have, what I call, an \"attack\". This will mean that I get a very strange feeling throughout my body, and then my bpm will skyrocket and I will be unable to really function until it's over. And it will eventually go down, without any intervention. Water often helps.\n\nThen for about 1-2 weeks after the \"attack\" I will feel extremely bad. Low energy, high heart rate (not 150+, but faster than normal), cold spikes. I will be unable to reliably function beyond laying around at home at the worst of it, and have a feeling of general malaise.\n\nMore recently I have had feelings of dizziness.\n\nI'll feel tightness in my chest sometimes. Often this will reach up to the side of my throat (I've been checked for thyroid issues and nothing)\n\nI have constant palpitations. Like, when I have a high heart rate it always comes with palpitations. Always.\n\nAnother important detail I left out is that oftentimes it feels like distracting myself can stave it off. Like if I'm feeling bad but I get into a conversation with someone or start having fun, then the symptoms become much milder or go away temporarily.\n\nAnd since I became aware of panic disorder, I tried to treat a recent oncoming attack that I could feel as that, and it didn't happen. I don't know if it would have happened if I didn't though.",

        "title": "AITAH for Physically Assaulting My Sister at Our Family Reunion After Years of Abuse",
        "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I (32F) need some judgment on what happened at our family reunion last month. This isn\u2019t something I ever imagined I\u2019d do, but after decades of relentless abuse and neglect, I finally lost it\u2014and things turned physical. I need to know: AITA?\n\n\u2e3b\n\nBackground\n\nI come from a massive, dysfunctional family. For as long as I can remember, my sister Lisa (35F) has been the \u201cgolden child\u201d and, frankly, a total bitch\u2014constantly tearing me down while basking in our parents\u2019 favoritism. Growing up, every family gathering was a minefield, and Lisa made sure I was always the target.\n\nLike when I was 12, I hosted my own birthday party\u2014a small celebration with a few close friends. Lisa, never missing a chance to assert her superiority, told everyone, \u201cI guess being the forgotten sister really does leave its mark,\u201d as she deliberately dumped a bowl of cold water on my carefully arranged party table. I remember the mortification and the way our parents laughed it off like it was just a harmless prank. That day, I learned that I wasn\u2019t worthy of warmth or care.\n\nOr in high school, I worked my ass off to earn a scholarship. I spent endless nights studying, convinced that I finally had a chance to break free from our toxic household. The night before my big exam, I confided in Lisa about my fears and the pressure I was under. Instead of offering any support, she sneered, \u201cYou\u2019re just going to fail because you\u2019re too pathetic to handle real success.\u201d Her words echoed in my head during that exam, and though I managed to do well, the damage to my self-esteem was irreparable.\n\nAt our parents\u2019 25th wedding anniversary, Lisa orchestrated a \u201ctoast\u201d where she recounted every misstep of my life\u2014from my failed relationships to my career misfortunes. With each insult, she made sure the whole family heard how I was \u201cthe eternal screw-up,\u201d effectively cementing my role as the family scapegoat. I sat there, numb and humiliated, while our parents smirked as if I were some cautionary tale.\n\nFor years, I endured Lisa\u2019s constant barbs and the way our family rallied around her while dismissing my pain as \u201coverreacting\u201d or \u201cdrama.\u201d I struggled with anxiety, depression, and even had a near-suicide attempt after one particularly brutal argument when she called me \u201cworthless\u201d in front of everyone at a holiday dinner. I eventually lost my job from burnout, the weight of these ongoing assaults finally crushing me.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThe Reunion That Broke Me\n\nThis year\u2019s reunion was held at a rented banquet hall in our hometown\u2014a setting that felt as claustrophobic and suffocating as our family\u2019s legacy of abuse. The atmosphere was thick with forced smiles and simmering tension. I had always dreaded these gatherings, but I hoped that maybe, just maybe, this year would be different.\n\nDuring dinner, after a series of backhanded compliments and snide remarks from various relatives, Lisa made the final, unforgivable cut. In front of everyone, with a venomous tone, she declared:\n\n\u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t such a screw-up, you wouldn\u2019t have lost everything. You\u2019re the reason this family is a mess\u2014always causing drama wherever you go.\u201d\n\nThat comment wasn\u2019t new, but it was the culmination of years of humiliation. It brought back every painful memory\u2014the birthday party drenching, the whispered insults during study sessions, the public shaming at our parents\u2019 anniversary. In that moment, every slight, every tear I\u2019d shed, and every night spent questioning my worth exploded inside me.\n\nI stood up, my body trembling with a mix of rage and sorrow, and shouted:\n\n\u201cI am DONE being your punching bag! For years, I\u2019ve been the one left to suffer while you, Lisa, get away with everything! I\u2019ve lost my job, nearly lost my life, and every time I tried to stand up for myself, you were there, laughing at my pain!\u201d\n\nBefore I could stop myself, I advanced toward her. In the haze of fury, I slapped her hard across the face. The slap resounded in the silence of the hall, and for a heartbeat, no one moved. Then, I punched her again\u2014this time landing a solid blow on her cheek. I felt a sick mix of vindication and horror as I watched her stagger backward, shock etched across her face.\n\nThe banquet hall erupted into chaos. Relatives screamed, some tried to pull me back, while others simply watched in stunned silence. My parents were mortified, and even the cousins who\u2019d once echoed Lisa\u2019s criticisms now looked on with a mixture of disbelief and regret.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nAftermath\n\nI fled the reunion immediately, disappearing into the night and spending hours in a friend\u2019s apartment trying to process what I\u2019d done. In the days that followed, the fallout has been immense. Some family members have reached out in support, saying I finally had the courage to speak my truth. Others have condemned me, calling me a violent, unstable wreck who destroyed what little semblance of family we had left.\n\nLisa has refused any contact, and our parents are at a loss for words. There\u2019s talk that this might be the end of our family reunions altogether. I\u2019m now facing not only the emotional repercussions but also potential legal consequences and an internal investigation by our family-run business.\n\nI\u2019m conflicted\u2014part of me is relieved to have finally unleashed the pent-up rage, but another part is terrified of what this means for the future. I\u2019m actively seeking therapy to manage my anger and heal from years of abuse, but I know I\u2019ve crossed a line that can never be fully undone.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for physically assaulting my sister at our family reunion after years of emotional abuse and specific, ongoing trauma? Was my explosion justified given everything I\u2019ve endured, or did I take things too far?\n\nEDIT:\nI know this isn\u2019t an excuse for violence, and I\u2019m not proud of what happened. I\u2019m trying to rebuild my life and establish healthy boundaries, but sometimes the weight of past memories just becomes unbearable. Any advice on healing or dealing with the aftermath of such a moment would be deeply appreciated.",

I never made up stories, never twisted the past. And now, you have the proof.\nI\u2019ve taken the blame for losing you. I\u2019ve beaten myself down over it. I\u2019ve accepted the lies about your health, carried the guilt for your attempt at suicide, believing it was my fault. You called me a cheater when I wasn\u2019t. A liar, yet never told me what I supposedly lied about. And the accusations didn\u2019t stop there.\nYes, I\u2019m an imperfect man, and I\u2019ve had my moments. But so have you. The difference is, I never stopped loving you, no matter what happened.

        "selftext": "I\u2019m currently in a 2-year-long, online/long-distance relationship with my partner (male, 19). My partner has told me recently that he has been having a lot of suicidal ideation and planning to commit. He wanted to tell me because recently it has been worse for him, he\u2019s been really overwhelmed, he\u2019s been zoning out, it has gotten worse. He has BPD so this all feels extremely intense for him. He said he feels he shouldn\u2019t hide it, because a part of the planning of it was hiding it. He said he\u2019s overwhelmed and that I should know because it will help him to not feel this way.\n\nThis is not the first time he has had these thoughts, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019s attempted. Really, he was almost successful a couple of times, so this feels extremely urgent and worrying for me.\n\nTo add to this post, I want to mention that, a little over a year ago, he had attempted. Being online, I don\u2019t have communication with the people around him, and in 2023 I thought he had committed suicide. He had been telling me about his thoughts and that he was depressed and did not want to be here anymore.  He had a failed attempt and was admitted to a psych ward, since i had no one to contact from where he was i was completely left in the dark. For five months, I went through real and proper grief of losing my boyfriend, the absolute worst feeling and time of my life. Since there was no proper confirmation, It was difficult for me to process and i always wondering if he was still here. I get panicked and extremely sad just thinking about it. Now, knowing him much longer, I could not imagine enduring any pain like that again, or even more now that we are even closer.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been hurting himself, he\u2019s been starving himself. He told me he was planning on going to a store to buy things to help him commit. He explains he\u2019s having extremely bad anxiety, and feels very out of touch with himself. he\u2019s been dissociating. \n\nI know that he will not reach out for support. I\u2019ve tried to get him to in the past, but maybe I have in the wrong way. He does not have a great support system where he lives\u2014his parents, the healthcare. The person he cares most for is his little sister.\n\nI just really need guidance on what to do in this. I care so much for him, and I take this extremely seriously, and with urgency. Are there any opinions or guidance I can get, please? Anything will help.",

        "title": "Update: walking-on-eggshells friendship is over",
        "selftext": "TW: potential suicide attempt \n\nI received really wonderful advice from lovely internet parents recently regarding a friend who is no longer a friend. Here\u2019s the prior post and I just wanted to give an update: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/s/27c0Bi4wx8\n\n**Update TLDR at the bottom**\n\nI told Anne (the troubled friend) that she needed help and that I could no longer be the main confidant if she has things to discuss about our mutual friends. I told her that her behavior was driving people away and that she needs to prioritize handling her feelings better.\n\nShe said all the right things - she apologized for \u201cacting crazy\u201d and realized it was unfair of her to dump all of her feelings onto me and have me handle her feelings for her. I felt like maybe this friendship could be salvageable. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever be as close as we were but I was willing to consider her a casual friend and at least see each other at mutual hang outs.\n\nShe ended up messaging the group chat that same night with Beth and gave a very\u2026 impersonal apology/explanation on why she felt the way she felt towards Beth. The long wall of text felt like more stabs at Beth than anything, until Anne edited the message to seem more friendly. But I already gave it a once over. And Beth didn\u2019t respond, still feeling hurt. \n\nAnne, in some kind of? spiraling frenzy?, started texting me and calling me, sending voice notes about how she doesn\u2019t understand what she did, how she didn\u2019t know what else to do since she finally did say something to Beth, and that she was spiraling and she needed someone to talk to. Note that she is also drunk, but I\u2019m not sure how much she had been drinking. I tried talking her down but nothing I would say reached her, and she accused me of dismissing her feelings (the same way she would say Beth dismissed her). She started twisted my words and I was getting extremely hurt and frustrated by all of her drama and accusations. I told her maybe we just needed a night to cool off and that she needed some water. She begged and begged to talk, but I didn\u2019t have any more spoons or patience to enable her. She called twice and I didn\u2019t pick up. I was also battling a cold so I told her to just send voice notes since I can\u2019t talk on the phone. I gave a half hour before I responded with succinct reply. By then she maybe worn herself out and said she was sorry (again, as she always does) and that she was now calm. I told her to get some water and some rest. \n\nThe next morning, she texted the group chat again to say she was in the ER all night. Apparently she took 6 benadryl and couldn\u2019t breathe so she ended up at the ER. She tells the providers it was an accident, but I knew it was no accident. She apparently took the benadryl to help her sleep but it was \u201ctook much\u201d. It seemed like she was looking for sympathy or maybe she wanted me/us to feel guilty that we drove her to do this, but I just tell her I\u2019m glad she is ok and leave it at that. I couldn\u2019t believe how erratic and intense her behavior was. It concerned me and angered me, thinking about how irresponsible and almost\u2026 manipulative it all felt. \n\nAt that point, I told her that she really needed help and that I needed space. She asked for more reassurance, asking if we\u2019d still friends and what the nature of our friendship would be like. I sent her a long, honest text saying that all of this was too much for me and that I needed space, and that I didn\u2019t appreciate feeling like I had to handle her feelings for her, how I always have to give her reassurance when her behavior was hurtful for me too. It all felt so emotionally manipulative. She said she will give me space, but the next day she texts me to clarify something she said (something that, in the grand scheme of what happened, was wildly unimportant). I was kind, but short. And then we didn\u2019t talk for a few days.\n\nI was happy not hearing from Anne because it felt like things could finally blow over. Beth had also asked for some space from Anne, and the both of us were breathing sighs of relief. But today, without any prompting from either of us, Anne sent ANOTHER long wall of text to clarify more things (as if we needed more clarification! No one asked for clarification!). It was the same nonsense she sent the first time - more over-explanations on why she felt left out, more apologies about the same stuff. Beth said thanks and immediately left the group chat. Then Anne left immediately after. I woke up to the fallout.\n\nI message Beth about it - she\u2019s as upset as I am. Upset that Anne just doesn\u2019t stop and doesn\u2019t consider anyone else\u2019s feelings but her own. Asking for space wasn\u2019t a way to punish Anne, but was a way for us to understand our own feelings about the situation and cool off. It\u2019s frustrating because Anne doesn\u2019t recognize her behavior at all despite all the apologies, which makes me wonder if any of them are even worthwhile.\n\nI ask Anne what did she expect us to say after this whole wall of text? I told her being her friend was frustrating and I didn\u2019t have much else to say to her, that I was ready to drop it for the time being, but she keeps bringing it back up. I told her that I\u2019m taking a step back from our mutual friends but telling them we had a fall out, and if she wanted to clarify (since it\u2019s apparently her favorite past time), she can tell them whatever she wants. \n\nAnne got passive aggressive with me, saying she was just reaching out an olive branch and she\u2019s \u201csorry if that offended the both of us\u201d. I told her that I was clear about my boundaries of wanting space, and she said \u201cwhat did I do wrong? I was giving you space\u201d, but she doesn\u2019t acknowledge that my needing space is on MY TERMS, and not for whenever she was ready to ask for forgiveness. She\u2019s insistent she didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and I told her I\u2019m blocking her number and I have nothing left to say to her. \n\nShe\u2019s insistent she\u2019s the innocent victim in all of this. I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s wildly lacking insight or if she just believes her bullshit so much, that she honestly thinks she\u2019s the one being wrongly persecuted. I\u2019m angry I spent so much time and grace, making space for her behavior and allowing her to make excuses with her emotional manipulation. I\u2019m sad I lost a friend, but it feels like I never really knew her; I feel like I was just lied to. I told Beth I was sorry I ever introduced them. \n\nTLDR: Anne doesn\u2019t know when to stop dumping her feelings on me and Beth. I try talking her down but she doesn\u2019t listen and I tell her we need to just let it go for the night. She spirals and takes too much benadryl (plus she\u2019s been drinking) and ends up at the ER. I tell her this is all too much for me and I need space. She gives a few days of peace, but she starts up again without any prompting. Fed up with her constant need for emotional supply, I tell her I can\u2019t do it anymore and block her number. It\u2019s a sad situation but I\u2019m happier without her. ",

I began to cut myself to feel some sense of power and control many times before my little sister walked into the room unexpectedly. She just stared at me and asked me why was I crying and I didn't have any words to say and she just kept asking if I was okay. The thing is sometimes I don't even feel like people around my age or my parents even notice the things I go through or the things that make me feel super upset, but once my little sister asked me that question, I tried to be as passive but honest as possible. I told her I was having a hard time and needed to cry, and she just gave me a hug and asked if she helped me feel better. And something like that, I feel like is all I need from others.

Before i even did the actual photo taking i felt the guilt, i cried for 3 hours till i fell asleep (this was after i sent it and blocked her).\n\nIts been months, i tried to forget and it mostly worked, but i overthink a lot about my girlfriends loyalty, her bodycount, if she loves me, etc, and i was worried about her cheating and the thought of \"how could you even blame her if she is when you did it yourself\" came up and i haven't been able to think since, i've just wanted to die, to disappear. She trusts me so much, she really does, and when i tell her this happened it'll destroy it all, i would be dead without her and she'd be dead without me - literally - i've helped her through many bad periods of her life in the short 3 months of dating together and she really trusts me and loves me, and i love her just as much back.\n\nI intend to tell her but i know that she'll likely break up with me, and even if she doesn't she'll never love me the same, i know it and feel it in my gut.

        "selftext": "Hey, apologies in advance\u2026 I know nothing about computers and I'm pretty terrified I might've fucked mine up permanently. I think I got hacked. (Also unsure how to tag this -- I'm going with Windows since that's what I use, but maybe Malware would be more fitting?)\n\nJust now, I was eating lunch and watching YouTube at my desktop. In the middle of the video, a new tab opened with what I think was my Chrome settings. I closed the tab without thinking about it since I'm used to Chrome opening tabs randomly from time to time -- it's usually a message about my ad-blocker -- and returned to the YT video. Another tab opened and did the same thing, then the YT tab also changed to that same Chrome settings screen and the word \"travel\" got typed into one of the text fields on that screen without me touching the keyboard. I immediately closed the browser and turned off my computer. Sorry for the lack of specificity or detail otherwise -- it was a split-second decision. I don't know how to address tech issues of any sort but I've heard horror stories, so I thought that was the safest course of action.\n\nLately (as in, past couple weeks/months), the computer's also been taking unusually long to power on and off. A couple nights ago, it kept turning back on after I turned it off and I had to unplug it from the wall to get it to stop. And I don't remember exactly when this happened, but sometime in the past week or so, I also got what I thought was a \"blue screen of death\" when trying to power it off. It stuck around for a minute or so, then powered off and was working as usual the next time I turned it on.\n\nLittle bit of backstory/context:\n\nMy computer is about 6-8 years old. My brother built it for me when we were teenagers -- it's a gaming PC because he thought that's what I'd use it for, but I mainly use it for writing, researching, and digital art. I only play a couple of Steam games. I'd consider myself pretty cautious about clicking links or downloading things, but occasionally while researching I'll click on something that I don't recognise as a link (for example: trying to enlarge a picture). When that happens, I get out of it ASAP and try to delete it if I see something new got downloaded, but it usually leaves me pretty paranoid.\n\nI defrag my computer every couple of months when it starts running slow (TBH I don't really know what defragging is, but my brother told me I should do it, so I do) and I keep the physical components clean. Other than that, I don't really do anything to \"maintain\" it. I'm hoping this whole thing is just a glitch stemming from that somehow, but I doubt it.\n\nI'm sure this is one of those Reddit posts you read and think \"how is someone this clueless?\" But I've never been good with technology. I've tried to research solutions to the slow speed and bizarre behaviour in the past, but I'm hopelessly confused at every turn.\n\nAm I in danger? Is my computer fucked? What about accounts I've logged into in the past? My photos/writing/art?\n\nPlease help your dear old grandpappy\u2026 :(",

Then you're a hypocrite.\n\nWell now. This is a ideological and cognitive warfare-induced trap. Don't hate them, Star Wars was created in America. Don't hate them, your Iphone came from Apple which is an American company. Don't hate them. See how you're driven off the point? How you're not convinced with good things, but you're just shamed into submission?\n\nThe entire world is forced to like and enjoy America - there's endless Manifest Destiny inspired legislation and numerous US foreign policy actions, in both Democrat and Republican administrations. The entire world is trapped by the culture, by the technology offered by them. And that is something that is the most evil thing ever. I know, countries don't have friends, they have interests - but imagine trapping entire countries and societies into self-harming submission or complacency just because it would be interesting for you to not have one more worry.\n\nIt cannot be compared to any personal situation before any of you say 'they have a right to push their interests'. It's most definitely different from you trying to sell yourself better in a social gathering or a job interview. It's a whole scheme, hijacking legal institutions with the sole purpose of securing interests that may be entirely corporate and not even help the average American.\nI purposedly left off assassination and support to dictatorships behind the curtains, some of which have hard evidence & validate even more my point.\n\nHating America is a geopolitical self-defense tool, to not allow yourself to be enchanted by the enchanting world of Marvel and DC heroes, Star Wars, Adam Sandler movies, Scream and Friday the 13th, Disney movies, Mickey and Minnie, and so on: they are all, directly and indirectly, tools that keep entire countries and populations shackled and submitted to interests that are often damaging to them - just because 'America is cool'.\n\nHating America is the duty of every person who wants their country to be truly sovereign. \n",

At all.\n\nWas joking with my coworker about how we're both royally fucked (she's a CS major).  My \"unique skillsets:\" I've been self-learning Chinese. My Arabic is passable. My first dream? Wanted to be an English teacher/ professor. I also like math and took a bunch of stats and upper division calculus as electives. I'm sort of interested in epidemiology. I can make cool graphs in Python and R. I've considered Epidemiology, but that requires at least a masters, which requires experience.... I work at a grocery store to support my family that lives in poverty. \n\n  \nI have panic attacks nearly every week, at this point, its almost daily. I'm on the minimum dose of Zoloft. I'm suicidal, but I didn't tell my psychiatrist that part. I don't know what to do.

        "selftext": "I came back home for a month on vacation. I\u2019ll be in second year of masters from April. I have always wanted to do a PhD. I\u2019ve been working on my current research for more than 3 years. I\u2019m someone who gets bored of things quite easily and tries to find new stimulating things to do. But I guess coz my research has a personal connection to my experience I just don\u2019t get bored of it. I get tired yes, but never bored I was very enthusiastic thinking about my PhD, already planning tons of projects related to my current research that I want to do. It is a sensitive topic and somewhere down the line I want to contribute even if my research\u2019s worth is as small as a mustard seed. I was so sure I wanted to do a PhD until I came back home. I have been arguing with my parents about this and the seed of uncertainty took over me since January. My parents want me to get married (they say that PhD and marriage can work together) they are also not against me doing a PhD. I know myself I can\u2019t handle these two. For the longest part of my life my education, and me being a top student was everything my parents wanted but now it has shifted to marriage as if it\u2019s the next goal to accomplish in my life and I\u2019ll be settled. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t even care about my academic achievements anymore they\u2019re just like meh. It was such a fucking big deal until yesterday. Now it\u2019s replaced with marriage. Since I came back home I feel like a selfish and self centered person for not wanting to marry and continue my studies. So for context I am doing my second masters I finished one in my home country and then got a fully funded scholarship to Japan. It was my dream. But I had to do another masters and honestly leaving my country and going to Japan was my priority I didn\u2019t care for what I was going. This was also the time I was completely financially independent like fr fr. It was such a blessing coz now I wouldn\u2019t have to argue with my parents for money (for necessities) I would live on loans from my friends. It was pathetic (and the part time culture is very twisted where i used to live). Now since I came back i am getting this \u201coh this person\u2019s son/daughter went abroad they sent back money and gifts\u201d and i just feel like such a shit daughter for not doing so (this time when I returned I didn\u2019t have enough money more time to go out and buy gifts, and I was struggling with my mental health wasn\u2019t even able to leave the room for necessities). Those people they\u2019re talking about they went abroad to work and I\u2019m here studying. I wonder if I should start earning after my masters just so I can send back money. I don\u2019t want to have an arranged marriage but the pressure my parents are going through from society (extended family) is immense and I can totally understand them. I am stuck at a crossroad and the decision that I make will change my entire life. On the other hand I planned to apply at Oxford for PhD all the negative thoughts now are just telling me \u201cwho do you think you are to apply at Oxford\u201d \u201caren\u2019t you being too ambitious\u201d \u201cyou really think you\u2019re going to get in\u201d and honestly speaking I thought of two options for PhD either to extend my scholarship here and apply for PhD at Oxford. Oxford has been my dream university since I was a kid regardless of my obsession with Japan. So I was thinking that I should give it a try and if I don\u2019t get selected I\u2019ll just extend my scholarship here. The university I\u2019m in and my current supervisor everything here is amazing. The environment is very positive and all the professors even if they aren\u2019t related to your research are ready to help if you ask them. I won\u2019t be very sad if I don\u2019t get selected at Oxford I will be a bit disappointed and upset. It will probably make me feel like I didn\u2019t deserve it anyway (and all the negative thoughts I\u2019ve had will be proven right) but on the brighter side I will still be in Japan and that will give me the opportunity to explore it more. After coming here I got a reality check and I was devastated for quite a long time and that time was me all by myself just doing my research and hyper focusing coz I knew if I stopped I\u2019ll break. This was also a reason why I thought of applying to Oxford. But at this juncture everything that I have done or planned just seems pointless to me. I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore and I know at the end of the day it\u2019s going to be me who\u2019ll make a decision but I would really appreciate it if someone helped me see better. Everything is clouded and I just feel so stuck that I can\u2019t breathe. \n\nReally sorry for such a long rant. ",

        "selftext": "The first 5 years of my life were fine, it was a privileged situation in my opinion. I did have problems, like my bio dad being depressed and suicidal, and him neglecting his parenting duties a lot leaving my mom to pick up the slack. BUT it wasn\u2019t terribly impacting me, I was happy for the most part and confident. I had a good mix of screen time and living in real life I think. Dad did let us have fast food and junk, which I wish he didn\u2019t, but overall it was good. We went to Disneyland a couple times in those years, life was good. But then my parents divorced, and things went downhill. \n\nWhen I was around 6, my mom was going to move into her new boyfriend\u2019s (my ex stepdad) house and let my siblings and I go to my dad full time, but last minute dad couldn\u2019t do it. So us 3 kids and my mom moved into this guy, who I met a few times, house. I remember being scared of the change, I had no help transitioning that I can remember, I\u2019d cry during the night and it kept the household up. Eventually my mom punished me, she set up a tent in the backyard basically forcing camping, and said \u201cyou can come back in when you stop crying\u201d and that was the start of me suppressing my emotions. Stepdad enforced it more, I was around 6-7 when he towered over me yelling in my face that crying is for babies. This was my first real experience with an asshole, and it got worse the longer we lived there. He was controlling as well, and abusive. I eventually started losing myself, I was scared to do anything so I didn\u2019t live my life. We lived there from when I was 6-15, but during those years I did have my bio dads every other weekend. \n\nIt remained similar to the first 5 years of my life, some people call it \u201cDisney dad.\u201d He spoiled us, let us talk any type way, took us to amusement parks, let us have unlimited screen time basically, went to sleep whenever,  and let us eat whatever we wanted.  It was worse without my mom laying down the law! Having what some people call \u201cjail\u201d with stepdad and mom, then having a \u201cDisney dad\u201d every other weekend, I don\u2019t think it was healthy for me as an autistic person. And learning that dad was abusive as well mostly to my siblings, just in a different way, makes me wish that we just stayed in the\u201djail\u201d like house instead of seeing dad, and I think I might\u2019ve tried to live my life instead of it being stagnant, if I didn\u2019t have dads to look forward too. My life from ages 6-15, I was just waiting for dads every two weeks, it was like a 2 day vacation for me. But knowing what I know about what he did to my siblings, I wish i didnt have that false sense of safety. Like people think Covid lockdown took their lives away? Those 9 years were way worse for me than that. I didn\u2019t really learn anything, because I had other priorities. Plus the first 5 years having things, that were then took away at stepdads? \n\nI wish I had ONE household growing up, now as a 23 year old who\u2019s been in therapy, and co dependent on my mom still, I know what I needed growing up.

        "selftext": "Hi, \n\nI just wanted to check in with the community and let you know my journey of ups and downs and let some people who\u2019s situation that may be similar to mine know that it can get better. If your diagnosis is much worse than mine, I\u2019m sorry and don\u2019t wish to discourage any of you. \n\nSo late August, last year I injured my back at work lifting a patient at work causing a disc bulge that was lightly pressed against my S1 nerve roots on both sides. This created debilitating nerve pain down both my legs and crippling back pain to the point that I couldn\u2019t think about anything but pain all day every day. And I couldn\u2019t do much either because of the pain. I had to quit work and my studies and future as a paramedic were also put into question. I felt like my life was over before it started and this put me into a deep dark spiral of depression and anxiety for what my future holds for me. Months rolled by and things weren\u2019t getting better, I struggled to enjoy the company of my friends and explaining what I was going through didn\u2019t achieve much because the pain was so invisible. There was a point I was becoming suicidal over the pain that felt like it would never let up. I did scans, physio, rest, perineural injections, all of it to not much avail. \n\nIt wasnt until about 3-4 weeks ago that things have started to take a consistent turn for the better, and honestly it was hard to recognise the progress at first because it\u2019s been so slow and there are good days and bad. But I can honestly say that my life has been improving and there are now streaks of days where the pain or symptoms haven\u2019t bothered me enough to give it more than a second thought. \nI can still get an achy back if I sleep funny or if I\u2019ve had a big day, but can honestly say the sciatica which was the most debilitating, has improved so much to the point where there are many days I don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there unless I focus really hard on what I\u2019m feeling. To think that one day I was so debilitated by it that I couldn\u2019t wear pants because the sensation on my legs was too uncomfortable. \n\nMy MRI didn\u2019t show anything super bad in the first place but my symptoms didn\u2019t reflect this at all for the longest time. And I just want people out there that might be at the start of something similar to me to know that it\u2019s not a linear path and that things CAN get better. You just have to hang in there. \n\nI\u2019ve started to be able to: \n- go out dancing with my friends without worrying about crippling pain the next day \n- go for bike rides through the city or bush tracks\n- run around with kids \n- go for long walks \n- play tennis \n- sit down in chairs without worrying about my legs being on fire\n- just wake up and decide I want to do something and go do it!\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not the end of the road for me, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not in the clear yet, but if you asked me when this started if I thought I\u2019d get to this position, I\u2019d think it was impossible. It\u2019s been about 6 months now and I hope things keep improving, but I\u2019m honestly over the moon that I can at least enjoy a day now. \n\nBest of luck to anyone out there, in a better or worse position than me. This was very poorly written and a bit of a ramble but I just want to provide hope for somebody because I remember when I was scouring the internet for success stories thinking it just can\u2019t get better. \n",

        "selftext": "I have ADHD and have been unmedicated my whole life besides maybe a year where I was basically a test dummy for Adderall XR and Vyvanse. I grew up not meeting anyone else who also had ADHD. It was a big thing to me I don't know why to meet others like me or to have a family with another individual who also has ADHD. I was lost growing up and wanted to guide my kid through it. I don't know to be honest. I met a person that was everything to me. And I move across the country for her. A whole year of flying to see her every two weeks it honestly seemed cheaper. Finding a job was hard but I managed after a bit. I have a problem with shutting down, I am avoident when it comes to relationship conflict. Overstimulation is a scary thing and I try to avoid it at all cost I retreat and avoid causing a mess. At least I used to do that.\n\nShe said I was abandoning her and it makes everything worse just as well shutting down makes everything worse. Everything I say is apparently an excuse. If I start crying she gets more upset and tells me I am manipulating her. She is constantly drinking and finishes handles one after another showing signs of alcohol addiction we used to talk about having kids it made me want it so badly. Her father passed a few years ago and mine passed this year and I was sad but she basically told me me that her dad did more for her and his death ruined her life more than mine dying did, I grew up with him not in the picture even tho he wanted to be. It's honestly a point of trauma for me and she knows that. I know she gets really jealous if she can't have it as well. She lost her PC in a sprinkler incident my 2000$+ PC that had to die so it did she fried it in a fit of rage. I had it for a year. I worked 4 years 11$ and hour to build it. Piece by piece gone in the blink of an eye. She is amazing and we used to be attached at the hip. I moved in with her because everything was falling apart at home. I am told what I am doing that I want to make her made that I wanted this to happen. I just keep trying to explain myself that I just want her to love me. I am just a lier and I wanted this. We don't go a week without her coworkers upsetting her, just to have her work herself up explaining it 7 different ways getting more and more upset and threating the coworker in some fashion to me. This process repeats over and over until she thinks about me then. Things I've caused or done over the years come onto me. The fact I was married before we dated or that I looked at porn a year ago. ( TMI We had sex a lot and I often put last her I ask her \"K.O.\" to know when I should stop she kinda goes senseless for a bit.) So blue balls was an issue and I did what I thought I had to. She found out and that was over from there. But that is where it starts and she just flies from there. \n\nTo stop making her mad with my crying I started cutting. It helped a lot. It was easier to stop the overstimulation I guess. Just focused something new. No real plan just lines for thoughts. Calmed up enough to attempt parley with dab hit or something, I learned I just get to were I don't talk about my problems I just focus on acting like everything is ok and just take what she tells me. I tell her I am sorry but that doesn't matter. She already decided I am guilty the point is to not be affected by it and act like she is right and hope everything is ok later. The cutting just covers my left are. She noticed, it just goes on like this. I told her I was suicidal and she told me I am just manipulating her. My friends disappeared after I started dating her. They all existed back in my home state and we're not cool with me leaving. Just as well she managed to hate them all and when I try to get back in touch she gets into this mode where she escalates her tone into a unhinged *aha torture or threat* much like when she talks about coworkers that consistently piss her off. Telling her I am talking to a friend just makes her mad. Everyone I make friends with is somehow scheming or thinking something. I just stop telling her what I am thinking, I don't tell her what I believe my beliefs of celebrating the dead is offensive to her. In my culture telling a memory of someone who is gone is an honor. To die is to know the truth and to experience the full aspect of life. My people do not cry we celebrate life. This is offensive to her and 100% explaining it makes her bring up how important her dad was and how inconsiderate I am. She asked me why I do not morn my father's passing. It was a mistake to answer, I no longer share my culture with her. \n\nI love her but Everytime lately I just think it's all pointless and that everything I wanted is just a joke. I am to old to do this anymore. I wanted this to be it. But it just feels like the end. A lot in my life didn't work out. I just wanted to have this one thing go right. I just expect it now everything always goes wrong or I say something to that makes everything worse. I was going to do it last night. I tried to put her in bed after a fight. She was in the tub, I just walked in toke by the hand hugged her and directed her to bed. As I walked out to find the spot I was thinking of my cat Stevie stopped me literally grabbed my are and hugged me like a teddy bear snuggling me on the couch before I could get my shoes on. I sobbed telling my cat how sorry I was. Passed out snuggling her. Before that everything was so calm. I was so calm it all seemed so rational, Like I was ment to do it. My cat saved my life.\n\nI don't know ",

        "title": "Queer Rejection.",
        "selftext": "I have rejection sensitive dysphoria. My friends think that my reaction to the following was way too much; but they don't understand. They're not entirely wrong, but it's not what I needed. I'm hoping that venting here, I might find people who understand how badly it hurts. \n\n---\n\nI put myself out there for the first time and tried asking someone out who I was friends with online; we seemed very similar, and I thought they were interested. My friends had been yelling at me to ask them out. I had never asked anyone out before, much less another queer person. But a lot of things were shifting in my life, and I wanted to try before it was too late. \n\nThey said they didn't have the mental space to meet up, etc, but that I was brave. I thought this had meant that they wouldn't have a the mental capacity for a relationship. \n\nI had noticed little details that my friends said I was overthinking about. I asked my friends, \"Do you think they'd tell me if they were in a relationship?\" I was raised by trauma, I notice the things most people dismiss. (I'm always right about those things. I hate it being right about those things.)\n\nYesterday morning I found out via a post they made that they had a partner. For at least a week. When I'd only confessed a few days prior.\n\nThey didn't mention this as I laid my heart out on the line. As I took all my courage and vulnerability and tried to put myself out there. \n\nI'm a hopeless romantic. I care too much. I let myself be so vulnerable with them, but it doesn't matter. \n\nI am not a serial dater-- I couldn't handle that. \n\nI understand that future me might have other opportunities. I don't care about that right now. \n\nI guess I'm posting here because I don't have a lot of queer friends and need someone to empathize. At this point, I don't want to open up ever again. I've had crushes on people who don't even know I exist and it would take me months to get over them. What more for my rejection sensitive dysphoria proving me right with my current situation. \n\nI'm still trying to make sense of it. How we wanted similar things, but in the end, they didn't choose me. No one ever does. I know, self-love, choosing myself, etc, I don't need that right now. I find myself wishing I hadn't put myself out there. It doesn't matter. Sure, nothing ventured, nothing gained, but also, no one gets hurt. \n\nI'm not purposefully going after what I can't have. Please don't psychoanalyze, I can assure you I'm too keenly aware. \n\nIt was a rough day for more than just this. It sucks because there were good things that happened, for once, but ultimately it had to balance out. And so now I'm a highly sensitive, empathetic hopeless romantic who's just not wanting to have feelings ever again. \n\nAnd yet, I can't help but wonder, if I had listened to my friends and asked sooner, would that have changed anything? (Probably not, they think.) I realize that all of this is a lesson. I'm just so fucking tired and heartbroken.\n\nI called out of work yesterday and was bedridden. I didn't eat, didn't care. I realize that it seems foolish and unhealthy, you really don't need to point it out. I care too much for my own good. It took me months to get over someone who barely noticed I existed, what more for someone I thought did. And we weren't even in a relationship. (Yes, I have depression and am neurodivergent, don't @ me.)\n\nA lot of things are about to change for me and I'm going to have to face them alone. I was hoping to tell one of my best friends some good news and that I was finally brave enough to ask someone out and that I had a partner. Instead, I had a breakdown and the good news was just news on the wayside. \n\nI had found community in the online platform I found them in. Now I can't go back. Gone will be my writing that people seemed to enjoy. Instead, I'm just occupying the void. I can't do this again. Never again. \n\nI did talk to my therapist, who understood my reaction. She knows the depth of my emotions, that I don't fuck around. Maybe I shouldn't have, for all the pain it's brought me. I'm over here thinking about how I've just been rotting while they get to be with their partner. How no one ever chooses me, despite all I bring to the table. \n\nNever again. ",

        "selftext": "To preface this, I\u2019ve had bedbugs before. My entire apartment building became infested when I was in grad school, about 15 years ago. It was one of the most psychologically scarring things I\u2019ve been through. Somehow when I moved to a new house, I didn\u2019t bring anything with me (lots of diligent heat treating, everything ziplocked, tossed a lot of things, you know the drill). My husband would come home to find me with the mattress against the wall, poring over every detail. It took me about 5 years to calm down, but it\u2019s always still in the back of my mind. Like, I love thrifting\u2014 but I\u2019m not about to risk it, you know?\n\nAnyways, fast forward to now. I live in a four bedroom house with my husband and two kids. Husband went on a business trip about a month ago. A couple weeks ago, he started noticing bug bites in pairs. He complained that we must have some super mosquitoes because they were so red and itchy. Instantly, you know where my brain went. We\u2019ve scoured our bedroom looking for evidence and haven\u2019t been able to find anything. I haven\u2019t gotten any bites, but he noticed some new ones yesterday. \n\nI\u2019m feeling really hopeless. It was one thing to treat an apartment\u2026 I have no idea how we will handle a house. I\u2019ve called an exterminator to do an inspection, but I\u2019m stressed. The potential financial strain this will put on us is also weighing on me\u2014 we\u2019ve almost paid off our credit card, which carries a balance as a result in of a particularly catastrophic year. The thought of paying for treating an entire house makes me want to cry. It feels like we can\u2019t win. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for. Words of wisdom, encouragement, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just sad. ",

I have a history of disordered eating (binge/restrict), and last summer I was the slimmest I've ever been; I gained a small bit of weight during autumn/winte and in the months before getting pregnant I was on a pretty severe cut and working out hard to get back to that point.\n\nI've always had grand notions that I would try my best to only gain what the baby needs, but I am SO HUNGRY all the time. It's insane, I am constantly ravenous, and if I even allow myself to get slightly hungry the nausea is unbearable so I find I'm constantly snacking, especially on carby bits. I'm trying to let go of the negative thoughts, but I'm really struggling. I want to slow down and relax myself and allow myself to just eat intuitively, but I'm plagued then with the classic binge ED mindset of guilt and regret. \n\nJust looking for thoughts from anyone who might be/have been in this situation.

        "title": "AITD for cutting off my ex online acquaintance because they were rude to me and disrespected my clearly expressed boundaries several times?",
        "selftext": "Identifier: Introverted Enby \n\nSo for about three months I (23NB) had an online acquaintance (20sNB) who I'll call T. We hadn't talked at all before this. \n\nThe first conversation we had, besides us saying \"hi\", asking about each other's day and us clearly explaining our boundaries with DMing which we were both fine with, was them venting. They also asked me where I was from and seemed a bit annoyed when I said \"the UK\". \n\nT would spend all of our conversations DMing me venting about being in danger of becoming homeless - they hadn't paid bills and something had happened to their finances. I comforted them and let them know I was there for them. \n\nThey wanted me to help them so I offered advice and help. For context, T was American and I'm British so we had different time zones. I'd be awake while they were asleep and I'd have to stay up when we would talk - usually an extra half hour but sometimes an extra hour or two or more. \n\nOne time when I was having trouble falling asleep while still talking to them, they begged me to stay up until 6am because they wanted someone to talk to because they were lonely and I reluctantly agreed. A bit later on, I said I had to go to bed and they got annoyed. They were being very guilt trippy too. \n\nThey would be annoyed at me when I told them I had to go to bed in general. I told them my boundaries about needing to sleep and not being able to talk sometimes and they seemed to understand. \n\nT also spammed me in my DMs if I didn't reply for whatever reason, regardless if it had been a minute, five minutes or longer. They did it on both platforms we talked on Twitter and Discord (I would just get notifications to several messages). And most of the messages would be \"...\" and \":/\" etc. \n\nI was also having problems with my WiFi at the time because it wasn't working so I was using my mum's hotspot and she would go out for dialysis three times a week so until that was sorted (about a few weeks later when we got a new router) there would be gaps in the day where I would have no WiFi. I did tell T and my other friends that as well (my WiFi is thankfully sorted now) and they understood. \n\nAnd T still spammed me. So when I was able to go online I'd see lots of messages. This was both on Discord and Twitter - and they also rang me on Discord. I don't use the call thing. I did talk to them after I came back online. \n\nThey would also go MIA for days and weeks at a time. I didn't want to constantly check on them because I felt like they would get annoyed by it. \n\nThey would turn up in my DMs after being MIA and be mad at me for \"ignoring them\". This happened a lot. \n\nThroughout this whole time, they didn't seem to want help despite asking me for it several times. \n\nI would sacrifice my sleep to talk to them as well. And they would only come to my DMs to  vent to me, spam me or be rude to me when I didn't reply straight away. And if they weren't doing that then they were outright not talking to me at all. \n\nWhenever I tried to talk about other things or stuff I was going through - which was very rare and mostly after they asked how I was - they either said \"I don't care\", \"At least you're not gonna be in my situation soon.\" and other things that were more rude. \n\nThey had asked me to contact some people to help them - including someone who could only be contacted through someone else which I tried to do but nobody answered. T got annoyed when I told them that. \n\nThey also asked a friend for money and their friend refused (but I don't know if they were broke or struggling with money or if that was why) and T got annoyed with that. \n\nI told them I had an idea for them to raise money with PayPal or other things like that but they refused because of personal information (which I kinda get but yeah). \n\nAnd they kept asking for help from me, yet refused any I offered (which was a lot) and complained when things got worse. \n\nMy social battery started to go down after being on social media and talking to people for a while. So I started posting online a bit less, let my other friends know and they understood. I started getting overwhelmed with how much T was messaging me as well. \n\nAnd I would panic when I got DM notifications because I thought it would be them. It usually never was. I told them that I was having trouble with my social battery and asked if we could talk a bit less if that was okay. They understood. I was drained at this point and had to recover my social energy - which took about two weeks.  \n\nThey went MIA during this but they came back and did it again. And it kept happening. No matter how much I explained my boundaries, they kept doing it.\n\nThey were also suicidal and wanted to die so a lot of the time I was also talking them out of doing it in addition to comforting them, listening to them vent and trying to help them.  \n\nThey also said that nobody cared about them, went MIA for a week or two again, came back and said it again. I did care about them a lot and others cared too. And as I said, stayed up extra hours to talk to them.\n\nAnd when they said that their granddad died, I offered my condolences and they lashed out at me. \n\nThen they blamed me for them being \"left sick in a homeless shelter\" even though I had no knowledge of where they were or would even be able to take them to one abroad.\n\nI had been getting too scared to talk to them in general because they were either too overwhelming and spammy or very rude and distant. \n\nThey said I was \"two faced\" and swore at me too. I just blocked them on everything we talked on at this point because I was sick of them constantly disrespecting my boundaries and being rude to me regardless of how many times I explained my boundaries and told them to stop being rude.\n\nI tried to help when they asked me. The things that I'm describing happened several times. They also apologized several times but sometimes did it in a way that suggested that they didn't care and other times they made out that they were the worst person on earth which made me comfort them. \n\nSo AITD?

        "selftext": "My current situation\n\nI was initially diagnosed with pddnos at 3 1/2 years old I found out that I was on the spectrum at 31.  I chose to get re evaluated and was diagnosed with level 1 autism at almost 32 years old at its worst it definitely feels like I\u2019m closer to a level 2.\n\nI struggle the most with eye contact understanding social cues and understanding humor and sarcasm. As well as having poor emotional regulation and overreacting to situations.\n\nI need a lot of support from my parents with problems that occur and situations in my life and at work. They take care of my finances.\n\nBut I\u2019m independent I live on my own drive take care of myself and take care off most of my affairs and work full time. I\u2019m currently unemployed at the moment got let go from my landscaping job two and half weeks ago.\n\nI\u2019m currently working on getting full time employment and have an appointment with dvr on April 11th to determine eligibility for disability services and employment services.\n\nI\u2019ve had significant depression and anxiety since last February after finding out about my pddnos diagnosis that was not disclosed to me for 28 years. I talked to my primary doctor and was able to get a prescription and diagnosis of major depressive disorder moderate and anxiety.\n\nMy doctor prescribed me Prozac. Which has helped so far I don\u2019t have many racing thoughts and worrying constantly and negative thoughts and emotions. I have a virtual appointment with my doctor to check how it\u2019s going on April 1st.\n\nI\u2019m wondering If I should increase the dosage. Or should I get a referral for a psychologist to get evaluated for depression and anxiety. I\u2019m currently seeing a nueroaffirming therapist that\u2019s definitely helping. He listens well and helps me deal with my issues related to my new autism diagnosis.\n\nI\u2019m glad I got let go from my landscaping job it was a very toxic environment and was terrible for my mental health. Finding another job that\u2019s compatible with my autism has been difficult.\n\nI recently got involved with a local disability organization that tried to get my two separate jobs. I fucked up the interviews really hard and didn\u2019t get an offer. The second one was worse because at the end the supervisor asked me if I\u2019d be interested in a position. I didn\u2019t give him an answer I was very overwhelmed. Especially because he asked me how good my math skills are and I told him very poor.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help my mom and the executive director of the disability organization were sitting in onthe interview.\n\nAnd the psychologist that diagnosed me said I barely have level 1 support needs. That doesn\u2019t exist. Period.\n\nMy mom did everything for me when I was younger she got me evaluated and diagnosed with pddnos at 3 1/2 years old and got me in special education at 14 months old and got me in the therapies I needed due to significant milestone and developmental delays I had when I was born. \n\nBut it seems to be that when I tell her about my struggles related to my autism she tells me a lot of people deal with these issues. The difference is that they last much longer for me are more intense and affect my functioning. \n\nI want to tell her and my dad how much I struggle wrih the things they don\u2019t see. Like my mom told me I\u2019m a success story, but even though my parents and most people view me to be pretty normal and not autistic. I struggle daily and it\u2019s very hard for me to describe to them exactly how my struggles affect my functioning. \n\nAny advice experiences or similar discussions would be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\n",

        "selftext": "My current situation\n\nI was initially diagnosed with pddnos at 3 1/2 years old I found out that I was on the spectrum at 31.  I chose to get re evaluated and was diagnosed with level 1 autism at almost 32 years old at its worst it definitely feels like I\u2019m closer to a level 2.\n\nI struggle the most with eye contact understanding social cues and understanding humor and sarcasm. As well as having poor emotional regulation and overreacting to situations.\n\nI need a lot of support from my parents with problems that occur and situations in my life and at work. They take care of my finances.\n\nBut I\u2019m independent I live on my own drive take care of myself and take care off most of my affairs and work full time. I\u2019m currently unemployed at the moment got let go from my landscaping job two and half weeks ago.\n\nI\u2019m currently working on getting full time employment and have an appointment with dvr on April 11th to determine eligibility for disability services and employment services.\n\nI\u2019ve had significant depression and anxiety since last February after finding out about my pddnos diagnosis that was not disclosed to me for 28 years. I talked to my primary doctor and was able to get a prescription and diagnosis of major depressive disorder moderate and anxiety.\n\nMy doctor prescribed me Prozac. Which has helped so far I don\u2019t have many racing thoughts and worrying constantly and negative thoughts and emotions. I have a virtual appointment with my doctor to check how it\u2019s going on April 1st.\n\nI\u2019m wondering If I should increase the dosage. Or should I get a referral for a psychologist to get evaluated for depression and anxiety. I\u2019m currently seeing a nueroaffirming therapist that\u2019s definitely helping. He listens well and helps me deal with my issues related to my new autism diagnosis.\n\nI\u2019m glad I got let go from my landscaping job it was a very toxic environment and was terrible for my mental health. Finding another job that\u2019s compatible with my autism has been difficult.\n\nI recently got involved with a local disability organization that tried to get my two separate jobs. I fucked up the interviews really hard and didn\u2019t get an offer. The second one was worse because at the end the supervisor asked me if I\u2019d be interested in a position. I didn\u2019t give him an answer I was very overwhelmed. Especially because he asked me how good my math skills are and I told him very poor.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help my mom and the executive director of the disability organization were sitting in onthe interview.\n\nAnd the psychologist that diagnosed me said I barely have level 1 support needs. That doesn\u2019t exist. Period.\n\nMy mom did everything for me when I was younger she got me evaluated and diagnosed with pddnos at 3 1/2 years old and got me in special education at 14 months old and got me in the therapies I needed due to significant milestone and developmental delays I had when I was born. \n\nBut it seems to be that when I tell her about my struggles related to my autism she tells me a lot of people deal with these issues. The difference is that they last much longer for me are more intense and affect my functioning. \n\nI want to tell her and my dad how much I struggle wrih the things they don\u2019t see. Like my mom told me I\u2019m a success story, but even though my parents and most people view me to be pretty normal and not autistic. I struggle daily and it\u2019s very hard for me to describe to them exactly how my struggles affect my functioning. \n\nAny advice experiences or similar discussions would be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\n",

I spend most of my time at home doing school, making dinner, cleaning up, working out, and generally feeling productive, but whenever I think of existing tomorrow and the next day, a wave of exhaustion hits me.\n\nI've done some amateur research about what this could be, and at times there were terms like \"brain fog\", \"high functioning stress\", and \"teen burnout\" that I related to at different times, but never wholely. \n\nI'm asking for myself and others, because I wonder if teens who live pretty normal, low maintenance lives also experience this? Is there anything I should be concerned about or look into further? \n\nAny meaningful insight is greatly appreciated.",

        "selftext": "Yes I want to die, its not like im a little kid throwing a fit, I just want to never exist again. I believe that life has no purpose by itself and people only live by giving it purpose, you become nothing if you lose all purpose and meaning. Im not really even what you call depressed I just dont see anything that can come out of life. Im 16 and yet I already feel this way, I dont find myself ever finding any friends, I have none and even people that talk to me arent close to me at all, nobody on my phone because ive never had anyones number so ill forever be friendless, maybe i was just unfortunate about how life went about me, i didnt have any mental issues or anything other than being a little quiet but yet i never found human beings I could show my real self to. Obviously if youll never find any friends youll never find another person to love, im not typing this to seek pity im just attempting to understand myself, Im not a good person at all. Im apparently so young yet ive abandoned morality already i cant seem to grasp it. Only now have I realized that im a porn addict not out of lust but because the release was the only thing that could make me feel but slowly that fire that kept me burning slowly faded away into ashes. Cant you believe it? Im an evil-pervert- loner at my age. Straight A student only because my father and mother set those expectations for me, i suppose i can say they love me and my relationship with them is pretty healthy but as I said im a bad person, I dont care anymore and I couldnt care less if they found my dead body holding a knife to my neck or stomach. I have a younger brother that is the reason why Ive been set free from life. He showed me that lifes impulsiveness can be a nuclear bomb that destroys everything and everyone, the spark being humanitys hatred. Everything is just a cycle. We find friends, we find a woman to love, we create offspring and die, buried beneath the earths surface. For a long while the only emotions ive felt are nothingness, sadness, and hatred, quite the amazing trio to have as its opened my eyes. We are nothing and everything, slaves to our goals and desires, constantly living in delusion that life matters, it doesnt in my eyes. Its funny how Id probably wouldnt cry over my parents' dead body but here I am crying over the last thing chaining me to the earth being destroyed, my computer. Im really a bad person. Aside from gooning, my only interest really was playing games but what happens when everything you do is meaningless and you feel nothing from everything? You want to die, and no im not your typical sucidial teenager i dont care if theres maybe people that love me i dont love anyone, ive abandoned that foolishness. I have no goals and i dont see myself living past 20 even i were to hold on for the meanwhile. Its funny how i attempted suicide at the age of like 10, and here I am years later still wanting to die, it just shows that maybe sucide is actually a good thing in some cases if that person is very willing to. Im glad i wasted time typing this because such as my brothers impulsiveness caused him to destroy the last chain of my life which is my computer, i feel like I could have really hurt someone, i was literally growling like some animal, but we are animals funny enough, i was boiling with hatred to the point where i could of sent both of us to hell. Speaking of religion I used to believe roughly 2 years ago but that faith slowly faded. Arent wars started off of hatred? We kill eachother and spiral into chaos being puppets of other humans. We are puppets of others and ourselves. I dont feel an ounce of light within me and i feel like god has abandoned me. But then why do i still feel this nothingness within my heart, human impulsiveness i guess, one moment you can be playing around with your brother laughing the next moment you couldve killed both of us, chanting die die die die die in the darkness as he went to lock himself in the bathroom (he hadnt realized he destoryed my pc yet), the door was locked and i ran around the house desperately searching for the key, it felt like my life gained purpose for a moment, and it was to harm my brother. You get why I call myself evil now? I feel anger at god, why did he send me on this path, forcing myself into hell if it does truly exist. I realize that i was so desperately searching for things such as love and friends that i became a slave just like the rest of these animals on a farm. Im sorry... very sorry. I tried to be merciful. I just turned off my brothers computer as a joke when he was playing roblox and he attacked me. When you hate someone you attack them, wanting to drain their soul. Yet, i still held back on my punches because i hadnt realized what he was about to do moments later, he went downstairs and killed me. He went back up as if nothing had happened (what i mean is that he took the haircomb and destroyed my computer, i didnt realize till i opened it later). Perhaps i had some hope of goodness within me, \"Dont do it! The pc can be fixed!\" But my blood was already boiling and i felt myself becoming something nonhuman. Well, i do see myself as human in the flesh but mentally im far from it. Nobody has to read this i just wanted to express my thoughts into words somewhere. Dont worry I dont plan on touching my brother anymore, maybe Ill beat him up but i wont unalive. But i am sure unaliving myself soon. Suggestions would be appreciated, maybe ill stab my neck with a razor blade, stomach with a knife, strangle myself with my hands (not working most likely), maybe a drug overdose. Im utterly hopeless and i dont care, I feel so free right now. Perhaps this is how true freedom feels like, being restrained by absolutely nothing in this world. Maybe big titties would save me but thats just impossible with how I am, keep in mind its not like im some outcast, I can talk with some guys and partner up with them, I just feel like im wearing a mask but the moment i die that mask is lifted off my face. Perhaps if reincarnation is real life will be more merciful to me, as i was to my killer, but mercy will get you stabbed in the back. Ill finish yapping now but i feel like if i gouged deep into my skin the only thing i would see is lifes nectar, the crimson, but other than that it would just be darkness and nothingness. I wonder what went wrong with my life. I suppose  this darkness grew starting highschool because it forced me to stop living in delusion. Maybe i just stopped being a slave to myself. Funny how since i have no contacts on my phone other than my first family, legit nobody would care if i died but i dont care about that, the taste of my blood gushing out of my vessel of hatred and darkness would taste like sugar. Im a really really bad person if i havent said it clearly enough, i dont want your pity but you can reply with your thoughts if you decided to read the yap session of a 16 year old boy. I might be more mature than some adults if i realize the truth of my very being. Hopefully my younger brother and sister can continue my bloodline because your older brother sure wont be. Okay good my hearts calmed down, it would be better if it just stopped in my sleep. A demon of hatred still lurks within me but ill be dead before i can hurt anyone else. And to finish off no im not killing myself because of roblox its a darkness much more deeper than that, its an issue only i can really relate to im guessing. End.",

I am 6'5\", light brown hair, blue eyes, bearded, mustached and wear glasses. We can exchange pics after the first couple of back and forths.\n\nFirst and foremost I am a Christian, I am part of a good community. My friends are very important to me (I don't deserve them lol). I am a runner and I completed my first half-marathon back in September, I just got a gym workout routine (making those gains woo), it became clear that eating well is super important so I try the best I can to meal prep and watch what I eat (I've lost 40 lbs.). I love history, reading, my latest obsession is Breaking Bad, I DM a dnd campaign regularly and I think I fit well into typical nerd culture though I don't watch anime (couldn't get into it sorry, though I've enjoyed some). I went on a long road trip two years ago which unlocked in me a love for travel and hiking. Feel free to ask me anything, I'm an open book. We could talk about the last book you read or the last I read ;). Give me your Diet plan and why its the best, tell me the coolest place you've visited (mine was the top of Texas \\[literally\\] ). Show me your favorite music and what it means to you. I like learning new things if my Duolingo streak means anything \ud83d\ude06\n\nI am looking for a wife ultimately and eventually if we really click I'll want to start talking about that (this would be after a good while, I don't think dating should be rushed through and I plan to thoroughly enjoy it).\n\nI want someone I can grow with, a companion that doesn't fix me, but rather challenges me to be the best I can be. I hope I can be that for you too. If you have read this far and haven't been scared off we should talk, I swear I don't bite and my friends would describe me as an easy going and natural converser. I hope to talk soon. Have a great day/night!",

        "selftext": "I feel as though I\u2019m being written off by my pulmonologist, and have only gotten worse since I started seeing him. I\u2019m 43f and have asthma (was diagnosed at 8), and have been on either advair or wixela since I was 19 or 20. I\u2019ve had issues with chronic thrush since I was a baby, which became exponentially worse in my early 20s after being on antibiotics for appx 6 months for a throat infection that was misdiagnosed as strep. My lungs are fine (just had a clear CT scan), but every URI I get winds up as secondary bacterial bronchitis. I also have allergies (mostly cats and dogs) which have been extremely well controlled for decades with fluticasone, and I have had multiple cats for years with zero issues, and have lived in the same place for 4 years.\n\nIn October of 2023, I had two URIs in quick succession that developed into secondary bronchitis. After a round of antibiotics, everything settled down, and I was left with a persistent cough, which is pretty par for the course. Except I\u2019ve now had that cough for a year and a half without any breaks whatsoever, and have been coughing up solid white chunks of mucus throughout the day, every single day since, accompanied by fatigue, shortness of breath, and heaviness in my chest. This escalated to me acquiring pseudomonas aeruginosa sinusitis and bronchitis about a year ago, after being away from home (with NO cats) for three months, for which I was on a week of cipro followed by 3 weeks of levofloxacin. It finally cleared up, but left the same cough, fatigue, etc as before. I was then out of state for four months, again with NO CATS, during which the cough, thick white mucus production, fatigue, shortness of breath persisted. I\u2019ve been back since December, my larynx is now chronically inflamed from the coughing, and his solution post CT scan is that I just need to go to an allergist. Prescribed me LIQUID nystatin and iprat-alburterol nebulizer, which I haven\u2019t even been able to start because he neglected to prescribe the machine (I\u2019m on Medi-Cal and cannot afford one out of pocket), and his assistant won\u2019t call me back and her vm is full. He scheduled a follow up in SIX MONTHS - no bronchoscopy, no sense of urgency whatsoever, and even wanted me to stop taking my advair, which is the only reason I can breath without constantly taking a rescue inhaler (it was a game changer when I was first prescribed it). \n\nI feel like I\u2019m crazy and that I should just accept that my normal is one of constant exhaustion and fatigue from coughing up solid chunks all day, not being able to talk or sing (which it gutting) because my vocal folds are just constantly slamming together, and that I should just be able to do all the physical work I\u2019ve always done even though it feel like someone is sitting on my chest. I don\u2019t know what to do, and I\u2019m becoming desperate and hopeless. Please advise \ud83d\ude4f",

She then suggested we use them in the therapy, and suggested that the next session (tomorrow) I should bring any game I like to play in the session or something.\n\nShit, I just- don't know. This therapy has been absolute hell for me, and honestly I dread going to any session. And it's not because of the therapist, I think she's great I guess. She has been very kind and patient with me. It's just that my life is an absolute mess right now and I've been considering suicide a lot again, and I guess the thought of going there and to just play videogames is... silly? A waste of time? Don't know how to describe it. Before anyone says that I should mention these suicidal thoughts, I don't think I trust her THAT much right now.\n\nNot only that, the games I play are mostly on PC or console and it's not like I could bring any of those to the session, hah. And I don't play that much on my phone, which is the only thing I bring there- I swear this sounds so silly now I write it up lol.\n\nHelpp \ud83d\ude2d any ideas or something about this??",

        "title": "Can I have some reassurance and advice?",
        "selftext": "My girlfriend and I are both 18 and began dating in March of 2024. I love her and she loves me. We both do so much and still do. Unfortunately, she has some mental health issues and is generally kind of unhappy. A couple times in our relationship she's done this thing where she says she needs a break or some space or whatever. Normally these would only be a few days. It always freaked me out. I have terrible anxiety and it started to consume me. Every day felt like she was about to call me and tell me we're done. It was so painful, but I realized that me feeling that way actually was making things worse because I was constantly asking her for reassurance and stuff. So I worked really hard to get better and while I continued to have the anxiety, I could tolerate it a lot better. Then, in January, she was staying the night at my house and she was really weird. Couldn't sleep and was crying. It freaked me out but I remembered that it's ok for her to be sad sometimes and I shouldn't automatically assume it's about me/she's going to break up with me. So I briefly tried to comfort her but fell asleep. The next morning she sat up and I think she asked if the roads were clear of snow to drive home. I told her I thought they were safe and then she said she couldn't date me anymore. I didn't beg or anything, I just let her go. That next week was hell. I continued to text her but told her to block me because I was expressing some suicidal ideation to her and I didn't want to hurt her by telling her that. By the end of that week we were back together again. She said it was a mistake because she has no issues with me or my relationship. Her reason was just that she is unhappy and in order to focus on feeling better she thought she needed to be apart from me because I take up too much of her time/energy/whatever. After that things seemed great to me. She promised that in the future she would tell me about these types of feelings when the arose. I was so happy and still so in love with her. Then, last night, after we had a nice day together, she called and said she had been thinking about our relationship a lot. She told me that it's just a lot for her and she needs to focus on getting better. She also said that \"too often\" when we are together she is not happy. This kind of hurt my feelings because she had been pretending that everything is alright to me even though she knows how anxious I get. Anyways, I said ok, let's not hang out for the rest of spring break. And so that was our plan. Today we texted and she wanted me to be honest so I told her that honestly I feel terrible and I'm worried about us yadda yadda. Then she called me again a couple hours ago and just said she can't do this anymore. She insists I've done absolutely nothing wrong. She says the only reason is because she needs to focus on getting better. We both cried a lot. We still love each other and if she has been lying about that then I don't know if I can trust anybody or anything ever again. Anyways, so, she said that she is going to try to get better. Remembering to take her medicine, I told her to get a counselor, talking with more people and making friends and whatnot. So we've been broken up for a few hours and I feel horrible. I drove around for an hour and cried nearly the entire time. I looked at her Instagram and she changed her profile picture to one of just her and took down the posts of us. Previously she hadn't done this so I think she is more serious about it this time. I think she is serious about trying to get better. This is the only real problem in our relationship and if she overcomes this depression or whatever it is then I see no issue with us getting back together. Should I be expecting this to happen? I'm going to try to start getting over her now instead of completely holding on and waiting but is it a bad idea for me to expect that one day maybe in a few months we will be together again? I can give any more details you think are needed. In the meantime, what should I do? I was kind of obsessive of her. She's the only person I hang out with and one of the only people outside my household who I text regularly. I think about her all day of every day. This is so hard because we both love each other so much. I just don't know how to go on. I keep imagining her coming and waking me up tomorrow and telling me that I imagined the whole thing and everything is ok and she hugs me. She's my first love and I don't know who I am anymore if I'm not her boyfriend. Please give your advice and thoughts and like I said I'll give any more details that you want to make a proper analysis. Thanks for reading.",

        "title": "Really triggered by a friend situation - need an outsiders perspective",
        "selftext": "Hi everybody\n\nSorry its very long, im really grateful to anyone who will read it through. Im currently waiting for a therapy spot and have nobody to talk about this.\n\nI (31F) am currently going through some sort of crash, where my life has completely fallen apart. Major things have gone wrong the last few years. Im currently only in bed for the last few months, also because of my chronic illness but also because im emotionally at the worst time of my life, where i just couldnt take it anymore. I have completely given up and am in a constant stress/anxiety spiral\n\nNow to the situation which I think is triggering me hardcore: I have my best friend Sara of 8 years, who is very understanding.We met at uni. There I also met another friend Lea, she wasnt a close friend for a while, but I introduced them to each other a while ago. Sara and I have been very close from the very beginning. Lea on the other hand was very hard to befriend closer, since she has always been quite unreliable and Sara has often been annoyed by this. But in the pandemic we became some sort of a group where we were all close with each other, but still Sara and I were best friends, because still Lea was unreliable (but less so). Dont get me wrong, I really love Lea, otherwise I wouldnt have tried for so long. It all kinda went weird when the year came where Sara and I turned 30. My birthday was first (which sadly had to be postponed because of a covid infection), and although I had a nice birthday party, it was really low effort by Lea. Then we had a project where Sara and I worked at and at the opening night they kind of abandoned me physically and we got into a fight. Sara and I could quickly solve the issue but Lea became really mean and ridiculed me for crying when I was upset. I forgave her, but it damaged the friendship majorly for me in hindsight. After that Saras birthday came up, and she was like a completely different person, she undertook major effort for her birthday surprise. That kind of broke me, because I felt really unloved and unworthy. She acted kind of cold at times there, especially after I made a mistake which I apologized for. Then we had a birthday trip planned for this friend, which i had to cancel a few days before because of health reasons and she ghosted me for 2 months and didnt write again until i confronted her. We talked and agreed and apologized to spend more time again, which again never happened on her part. And then she started working at the same firm as Sara as an intern last year. Everytime I asked her to hang out the last half year, she kind of had an excuse or cancelled shortly beforehand. I got sadder and madder in those last months and it felt like she was quitely quitting this friendship, withouht having a real talk with me. This has happened to me before with other friendships, reasons being my chronic illness, and it has deeply traumatized me. Now she got a real position at this firm  (Saras workplace) and they will be hanging out constantly probably and it feels like i will be completely left out, even more than now.\n\nIm feeling now intense jealousy, but moreso even intense sadness, feelings of abandonmrnt and wortlessness and hopelessness. I never talked to her about the birthday thing, and most of the things, only about the ghosting part. I wanted to write her a letter and told her almost 2 months ago, I would send it. I wrote the letter but never could send it to her. I just couldnt. Because it felt like she will react the same way as the last time when I told her how Im feeling, it feels very unsafe, not like a safe place at all.\n\nI would love an outsiders perspective, am I projecting? Is my anger misplaced? What would you do in my situation?",

        "selftext": "Hey folks, hope you are having a splendid day. I have made another attempt at my query letter and would love to get your feedback. Just FYI - the last critique I got was that it was technically ok but did not have any soul. Please let me know if this iteration manages to capture the magic.\n\n\\----------------\n\nDear \\[**Agent name**\\],\n\nFarees, later in life, is musing over the kinds of lessons life has taught him. He grew up in a Muslim family in a slum in Hyderabad in an India recently recovering from the Emergency of Indira Gandhi and the ongoing USA\u2019s War on Terror. He learns that one must know the deepest of truths to make up the best of lies. He recalls a story \u2013 the story of the best and the most necessary lie he has ever told.\n\nExorcisms, beating kids, scams and police chases were the norm and perhaps, still are. Teenage comes along and he befriends others with similarly troubled backgrounds and they start fancying themselves to be spiritual adventurers aiming to discover the secrets of the universe. He develops a close bond with another teenager Makso and perhaps, calling that a friendship would be a stretch but they still cared for each other enough that they got into a lot of trouble together. The pulsing streets of Hyderabad provided ample bastards to fight and rage was their friend. Religious scams were aplenty and Makso falls for one such Sufi master who, on the one hand, gives Makso guidance to deal with his troubled life but on the other hand found ways to extract money from him. Makso runs away from home after hospitalizing his father and starts believing that dark powers using black magic were trying to steal his soul and that his parents were behind it all.\n\nFarees is suspicious of the whole situation and decides to meet Makso\u2019s parents to get to the bottom of this mess but when he visits them, he sees a crying mother but not an evil witch, an angry and despondent father but not an evil man. Farees decides to help the parents but if Makso were to find out about it, any remnants of trust between Makso and his parents would be forever lost. Lies were needed, deceit was necessary and pain was in abundance. Farees had to now maintain a lie for Makso, a lie for his parents and a lie for the Sufi master while not letting any of it spill over into his own family.\n\nA series of adventures follow, from planning suicide to planning murder to street fights to accidents and some poor buffalos dying. The death of buffalos is more important than you might imagine but more importantly, the prophet of Islam appears in a dream and an apartment gets burned down while Makso was sleeping. Makso lights a cigarette in that fire and hides behind a wall waiting for the gas cylinder to explode. Everything starts spilling over into everything else and Farees tries to find a way through the madness and get to a happy ending, whatever that even means. When talking to Makso\u2019s mom Farees realizes that she might not be as innocent as he had assumed. He learns the difference between a lie and a sacred lie and the importance of kindness.\n\nI am seeking representation for\u00a0*SILSILA OF SACRED LIES*, an upmarket/book club fiction of 80,000 words and am writing to you because you \\[**personalized tidbit about agent; see previous representations and twitter**\\]. This is my first book and I am a nobody from nowhere but the one thing I am good at is lying. A good story is necessarily a good lie. I hope that this lie entertains you for a few hours.\n\nThe book does share some resemblance to Eldonna Edwards\u2019 *Clover Blue* in so far that it describes a coming-of-age of young boys, familial estrangements and deals with a cult-like setting but it differs in its raw depiction of street life which are closer to Fernanda Melchor\u2019s *Paradais*. The particularities are, of course, very much Hyderabadi/Indian.\n\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\n\n\\---------------------\n\nPS - For unspecified reasons, I have been downvoted and am now living in the land of negative karma which means that I am not able to post in the Beta readers community. I would like to very much post in that community and if you liked the query above, would you be kind enough to send me back to the paradise of positive karma? Much appreciated!",

So why hasn't he found the one?\nAt forty-five years old, he's tired of the dating scene, tired of not clicking with any\nwoman that crosses his path.\n\nHe's over it.\n\nRachel Garcia hopes for a better life, but for now, she bartends at her overbearing\nUncle Dexter's bar. And as for love, she has a few rules. No dating customers, no\ndating older men. Sounds simple enough. Yet, it's the rheumatoid arthritis she's\nbattled since childhood that makes everything feel so difficult and hopeless. Why\nwould anyone stick around long term? Chronic illness isn't something you expect to\ndeal with at thirty.\n\nLife is so unfair\n\nThen Johnny happens. He's a customer, fifteen years older, and everything she\ndoesn't want. As luck would have it, she's forced to see a lot of him when he joins the\nlocal pool league at Dexter's. Now, nothing is ever the same. With her heart or her\nlife.\n\nJohnny is smitten. Sparks fly, and chemistry erupts unlike anything he's ever felt\nbefore. Dates spent stargazing with her are the building blocks of the love story he\nhas always desired to have. If only it were that simple. Rachel's insecurities, a\ndangerous uncle who runs an illegal gambling ring, and an ex-fianc\u00e9 who wants her\nback, all threaten to destroy Johnny's last shot at love.\n\nTrigger Warnings:\n\ud83d\udd39\ufe0fDeath of parents (off the page)\n\ud83d\udd39\ufe0fGaslighting\n\ud83d\udd39\ufe0fChronic Illness Pain\n\ud83d\udd39\ufe0fPhysical Violence (man vs man)\n\ud83d\udd39\ufe0fControlling Relative \n\nDelivery/Expectations:\n\ud83d\udd39\ufe0fARCs will be delivered on or by April 14th\n\ud83d\udd39\ufe0fReviews requested on Amazon (on release date of May 27th), Goodreads (anytime), or any other review app of choice.\n\ud83d\udd39\ufe0fIf reviews can be done by the release date of May 27th that would be awesome. \n\ud83d\udd39\ufe0fThe link to apply is below:\nhttps://forms.gle/bGR7hxq4B4MzCUed8\n\n\n",

Usually they swap on weds. \n\nWe aren't talking at all (she lives with me so I've just been working outside outside stay busy) \n\nAnd today I didn't notice her leave for school pick up. \n\nTime passed and still nothing but I did have a text saying 'you're fucked up, stay the fuck away from me\" \n\nNow, I talk to her ex and he tells me he put in emergency custody application that was granted. \n\nDeep down I know that's for the best.

It's a wierd place to be. \n\nShe's blaming me and I just need someone else's take on this. \n\nHere's some pics of the apple watch, confirming her arrival from her ex boyfriends phone number, and here's another picture of her trolling me to her family friend about everyone searching for her as if it was some game of hide and go seek. \n\nMy mom killed herself three years ago. I had no clue she was going to do it but she did warn people right before and Noone took it serious. Welp, I found her dead a day later. \n\nI don't play with that suicide thing anymore and it's not the first time the girl has said that.

        "title": "Transitional Spaces",
        "selftext": "# What is a Transitional Space?\n\nTransitional spaces are defined by moments when your old self\u2014the version of you that got you to where you are today\u2014is not enough to take you where you want to be. There's a growing realization that continuing the same old patterns will lead you far from what you once envisioned for your future.\n\nTake the example of John, a client I worked with. John had everything he had aimed for: a wife, kids, a successful career, regular workouts, and a secure future. Despite these achievements, there was a part of him that yearned to shake things up, just to\u00a0feel\u00a0something. By his own admission, life was exactly what he had strived to achieve, yet something vital was missing, and it troubled him deeply.\n\nJohn was in a transitional space. He faced an important decision that would affect the rest of his life:\u00a0*Do I just accept that this is how it's going to be, or do I change something? What needs to change?*\u00a0Concerned he might subconsciously do something reckless, he knew he had to figure it out in time.\n\nTransitional spaces can creep up on us or slam into our lives like a train\u2014be it through a death in the family, a job termination, or a divorce. Other times, they feel like a persistent tickle in the back of your head that becomes increasingly annoying.\n\nTransitional spaces are an incredibly common human experience, but we don\u2019t often have great tools for them because the journey is so unique to you. Book, videos, clips, and social media posts seem to dance around your issue, without giving you that epiphany moment.\u00a0That\u2019s it!\u00a0And that is frustrating because while it seems so common, you still feel isolated and alone about how to figure this out.\n\nUnderstanding these periods is crucial because they signal the need to intentionally become the version of yourself you aspire to be. This new version lives without anxiety, helplessness, or the feeling that joy has faded into flatness.\n\nThese moments offer us a fundamental question:\u00a0*Who do I want to be now?*\n\n# Calling Out Transitional Spaces\n\nHave you ever felt like you're being pulled in different directions, knowing deep down that something needs to change?\n\nTransitional spaces are often marked by a profound sense of anxiety. This arises because part of you recognizes the need for change, yet another part wrestles with uncertainty. The echoes of past failures might erode your self-confidence, fueling an inner conflict that, if left unaddressed, can spiral into deep, pervasive hopelessness and depression.\n\nIn these moments, many experience a stuck feeling\u2014a cycle of anxiety and depression that seems endless. Some may find temporary relief by resigning themselves to their circumstances, which might lessen the intensity of their feelings temporarily. However, this often leads to seeing the world in shades of gray. When nothing seems interesting or worthwhile, the anxiety inevitably begins to seep back in. You find yourself in a transitional space where the familiar routes and old maps no longer serve you. The only way forward is through a path yet uncharted.\n\nRather than accepting this as the status quo, my clients find it valuable to acknowledge these challenges as invitations to embrace their growth. Ignoring the issue isn\u2019t going to make it disappear.\u00a0*What if the maps you have no longer show the road you need to take?*\n\n# Moving Beyond the Transitional Space\n\nHave you ever sought advice and gotten this response: \u201cYou should journal more.\u201d Or \u201cPractice mindfulness,\u201d or \u201cSet small and manageable goals.\u201d How did these work for you?\n\nYou know these are important, and helpful. You also just\u00a0*know*\u00a0they won\u2019t be enough. While mindfulness and journaling are often suggested, they are most beneficial when you're already on the right track and need focus and presence. But what if you feel completely lost?\n\nWhen you're disconnected from what truly matters, journaling can feel fruitless, and traditional goals may seem untethered to your deeper desires. These methods don't always resonate during transitional periods if they feel disconnected from a deeper purpose.\n\nJohn already knew about these strategies. However, he felt that they weren't addressing the root cause of his discomfort. He needed something more potent: a transformational solution that could delve into the core aspects of his personal limits and invisible barriers.\n\nTransactional solutions often reinforce your existing identity and what has worked in the past. But transitional spaces are different. They demand a reevaluation and reinvention. John recognized that the old ways weren't going to work anymore; he needed to fundamentally change to reach the next level in his life.\n\nTransformational experiences provide the missing piece. A transformational experience connects you with who you need to become.\u00a0*What version of yourself wants to emerge? What wants to come through?*\n\nEach person is whole and complete already. As you connect with your truth more through life\u2019s experiences, a time comes when there are parts you are called to let go of, and parts you are asked to let come. Our minds can become burned with beliefs and thoughts that have way more power over us than they should. Transitional Spaces are times we learn to release those limits, while feeling the power of our true self, without letting that awesomeness frighten or overwhelm us.\n\nTransformational Spaces are healing spaces. To heal means to feel that you are whole and complete. It means to experience yourself as you truly are!\n\n# What\u2019s Next?\n\nTransitions are gateways to growth and self-discovery.\n\nI invite you to take it head on. We all know that an experience is always more meaningful than words. John is another great example. We started with *a\u00a0powerful coaching experience*,\u00a0and it profoundly impacted him. He found it to be exactly what he had been missing, marking the beginning of a significant transformation.\n\nThe relationship we create is unique. It\u2019s defined by clear objectives and free from the complications of dual relationships. Dual relationships often arise when we ask for advice from those within our social circles, whose advice may be unintentionally biased or limited by the existing dynamics of the relationship.\n\nIn our coaching relationship, my sole commitment is to your personal growth. I'm not just a friend, although I am friendly; I'm not a therapist, but our work together can be deeply therapeutic. My role is to challenge your doubts, to help you see that what may seem\u00a0impossible\u00a0can become\u00a0inevitable. I'm here to allow miracles in your life to come to you\u2014a type of relationship most never get to experience.\n\nI offer you the same powerful coaching experience that transformed John\u2019s life, tailored specifically to your needs.\n\nTo schedule, visit\u00a0[https://calendly.com/spellitoutdavie/time-for-a-life-changing-coaching-experience-r](https://calendly.com/spellitoutdavie/time-for-a-life-changing-coaching-experience-r)\n\nBefore you decide, take out your phone or a piece of paper and write down the doubts and thoughts that are discouraging you from scheduling this session. Then, **schedule it anyway**. After our time together, revisit these notes. **I'm curious if you'll see your doubts in the same way.**\u00a0\u00a0*What would it mean, if you no longer agreed with what you wrote down?*\n\nI am committed to supporting you as you meet this next chapter head on. You\u2019re in a transitional space. If we create a transformational space out of it, who knows what can happen!  It\u2019s a profound gift, and I look forward to helping you realize just how valuable it can be.\n\n# What others are saying:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ccbp7nlb4re1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0b2b8a8119de1ce394db6c8cbc8a78cd281027\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/51xvza5hb4re1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=cea2ad442fc333ccfb93c7210bab16f4b5099c37\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1zmlesfpb4re1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0e6d97f3e15a8f6615be7adab6ada5c4a05bdb4",

        "selftext": "WEST PALM BEACH \u2014 Nurses found a psychiatric-care patient strangled in the bathroom of a South Florida Veterans Affairs hospital in 2024. Investigators said his killer left a Bible on the floor with a hand-written note: \"God, I have lived a good life. Take me home.\"\n\nFederal agents found a black pen and the same handwriting in a Bible on the bedside table of the patient's hospital roommate, 34-year-old Christopher Schweikart. The former military pilot told a nurse he strangled 69-year-old John Russell Anderson with both hands, positioned his body on the toilet \u201cso it would not look so obvious,\u201d and then returned to bed.\n\n\"I just want to die. I want to die so bad,\" a nurse said Schweikart told her. \"I killed the guy. I put my hands around his neck. He wanted to die.\"\n\nSchweikart appeared in federal court for a one-hour bench trial this month, one year after the killing. He neither called witnesses to testify in his defense nor disputed the facts read aloud by a federal prosecutor. But, Schweikart's lawyers said, he wasn't guilty, either.\n\nArmed with doctors' reports, defense attorneys Robert Gershman and Edward Reagan said Schweikart suffered from major depressive disorder with psychotic features \"and did not appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions\" at the time of the murder.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Marton Gyires agreed. The prosecutor, who persuaded a grand jury last year to charge Schweikart with premeditated murder, asked U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg to acquit him instead. She did.\n\n\"This was the very, very unique case where everybody agreed he was insane at the time. There was no dispute about it,\" Gershman said. \"It was just a matter of the Department of Justice doing the right thing and getting the process in place to get him better, so he's an asset to society in the future \u2014 whenever that is.\"\n\nSchweikart, a Virginia native who piloted Chinook helicopters during his eight-year military career and later served as a firefighter in Washington, moved to West Palm Beach in 2023. He worked in renewable energy development for NextEra and had no prior criminal history.\n\nSpared from death row but committed to a federal psychiatric hospital until he\u2019s deemed fit to reenter society, Schweikart whispered good-bye to his wife, Autumn, who stood beside his mother, stepfather and mother-in-law in the courtroom gallery on March 19. No one from Anderson\u2019s family attended the brief trial.\n\nIn an interview afterward, Autumn said she thinks about Anderson and his loved ones every day \u2014 as well as of the system she believes failed both him and her husband, who checked himself into the VA hospital for delusions and paranoia two days before Anderson's death.\n\n\"He went in to get help, to prevent him from hurting himself or anyone else, and instead of getting help, he was just completely failed by a negligent system, negligent staff,\" Autumn said.\n\n\"In my opinion, they're the ones who should be sitting in the courtroom. They're the ones who should be on trial.\"\n\nAndrea Madrazo, a spokesperson for the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center, said the agency conducted an internal review after Anderson's death and found the facility to be in compliance with its policies and standards of practice.\n\nShe added that out of an abundance of caution, staff members have since received additional training on observation policies and ways to de-escalate and manage \"disruptive behavior.\"",

Before SSRIs, my mental was not this bad and i never felt this irritable. \nI never thought that I would feel this way or get the \u201ccold feet\u201d that everyone talks about before getting married. My partner and I have been together for 5 years and we live together. His family is my family and vice versa! He is my family, my best friend, and so many other things. He has been there for me through it all and accepts all of my imperfections and flaws! He was there for me when I had an inpatient stay at a facility due to suicidal thoughts and so much more. He always is willing to help me or do things for me or make me feel loved in any way possible. We both work full time and spend a lot of time together during the weekends rather than the week days. We both have been feeling burnt out from work thus finding ourselves in our phones a lot together or watching tv a lot to destress. \nI have been finding myself snapping at him very easily and just irritability around him sometimes. It\u2019s almost like the sound of his voice or like something about him just makes me annoyed. There are a few things that i dislike about him but obviously, these are minor things like how he chews with his mouth open lol. I also have been noticing that i am craving attention from other men. For example, sometimes i will think about reaching out to exes and i have before to catch up and see how they\u2019re doing..it never gets flirty or weird and i always shut it down. But it almost feels good to talk to someone else and get that rush of excitement i guess even though i wouldn\u2019t realistically want to be with them. Sometimes i think about if we were to break it off, and for a moment i feel relief but then sadness too\u2026i think i feel relief because of the stress of the wedding but also his family. \n\nwith that being said, Im worried that our spark has run out ): We are supposed to get married this year and i just don\u2019t love our life together. I feel so bored sometimes and just like life is dragging. I can see myself having kids with him and growing old together but i\u2019m not sure how to fix my irritability and the lack of excitement sometimes. Has anyone gone through the same thing and gotten through to the other side? I\u2019m feeling very emotional and just sad about all of this. \n",

Basically anytime me and my husband get into a bad argument I go from 0-100 and start idealizing suicide. The reason for today was because I am a sex worker and I had a really creepy client the other day who was talking about underage girls and it freaked me out (I\u2019ve been doing this for 10 years never happened before). Anyway I flipped out on the phone with my husband saying I don\u2019t want to do this anymore and he got defensive and upset and hung up the phone on me because he thought I was \u201ctoo negative or putting my anger on him\u201d the truth is I was just depressed and needed some encouragement. He always says quit then ! But it\u2019s not that easy I only know what I know and every single regular job I\u2019ve had I\u2019ve been sexually harassed by either my co workers or my boss so I was like I\u2019m gunna charge for this. But now I don\u2019t know how to get out and being schizophrenic doesn\u2019t help either I\u2019ve lost jobs and been fired cuz of my symptoms or med side effects. Anyway when my husband hung up on me I flipped my shit and blocked him and then the cops got called for a welfare check. Life sucks sometimes being mentally ill and being a woman and you have to pay to live but I don\u2019t have a college degree or any real experience and my skill set is so limited.

        "selftext": "My dad is a verbally and emotionally abusive narcissist. My oldest sister had to leave because he made her life a living hell, cameras in her room to watch her and lecturing her for hours in a locked room. He's moved onto us now, especially my second oldest sister and I. I hate my life there. There are good times, I have to mentally separate \"good dad\" and \"bad dad\". Lately Bad Dad comes out more. He's been utterly humiliating and be meaning my older sister (18) for wanting to be a teacher, mocking her in her abilities and how she won't survive in life. He makes not so subtle jabs at my mom (they're divorced-he cheated on her more times than she could count and made her feel like it was her fault.) because she's a substitute teacher. All my life he's manipulated us, making me think therapists were out to worsen my problems and didn't care about me-only for his money. He told me my mother didn't care about us enough to actually deal with our problems, instead giving us therapy and medications (she was the only one to actually listen, help, and talk to us about these issues) Most of my problems are from the betrayal of him cheating. The first time it was with my Moms BEST FUCKING FRIEND, and he just kept on going. I'm repulsed by him. Basically, he's a piece of shit. \nLast Friday, my older sister politely asked him to not talk to her about her choice to go into teaching. He picked apart every argument, every word she said and turned it against her, saying she wasn't mature and the real world would tear her apart. I was already angry, this set me off. I did crash out on him, I was yelling and telling him everything basically I said above. I focused on the cheating-its been eating me up from the inside. And the damn narcissist responded coldly and calculated, no emotion as he deflected and made excuses. It was the marriage in the first place (I talked with my mother about this prior-it wasn't. They were best friends. HE ruined it.) it took two in a relationship (Yeah, and you didn't put in your part) they were immature and messed up (partly true, married at 19, both from broken families, STILL DOESNT EXCUSE) and worst of all, he brought up how first of all, he was sometimes stuck at 6 (from trauma of being neglected and stuff) and my mom at 12 (she was in a SA home, SA by her step brother) but he said she wasn't really SAd. Idk I'm rambling right now. Anyhow, I got my mom to come pick us up because we weren't staying with that asshole.\n\nNow he's saying he's going to enforce court orders and take us away from our church. \n\nYes, we do have him on weekends. It is court ordered. The only times we don't go is when he puts us in such an emotional and broken state we can't bear to be around him without crying or being suicidal. My siblings have hurt themselves after 'talks' like those. When we are so emotionally spent, we have to have a break. I understand the court orders are to be followed, but honestly I don't care. In those moments I feel like I'm going to die and I have to get away. \n\nOur church is large, so it's divided according to geography. One congregation / ward is for one high school, the other for another (people who are in those boundaries, so everyone is relatively close and knows each other) my dad is in a different ward from us. He told us today he is making us switch, away from our friends, our community, and our support. The people there know ME, they know US. Our bishop works with us to deal with the emotional issues and make sure he takes responsibility (letting his bishop know, he actually called CPS because of what we've told him.) I can't think of not being in that ward. And he's taking it away.\n\nTldr: my dad is a big freaking jerk and because I got mad at him, he's taking us away from our church network that gives us comfort, security, and peace, as well as making it so we have to always be at his house even though we want to hurt ourselves when we're there",

        "title": "Sudden fear of death from 3 year old.",
        "selftext": " My 3 year old is suddenly very focused on and scared of death. Here\u2019s the history and what I\u2019ve done/said. Wondering if there\u2019s anything else I can do to support her through this process. \n*we are not religious*\n\n\nHer dad and I had a dog that died before she was born. There are pictures of him around the house, and we talk about him a lot. A few months back, she asked where he was, and I told her that his body got very old and he died. But that he lives on in our memories that we can share with each other. \n\n\nThree weeks ago, a friend of ours had to put their dog to rest. They told me, so I could tell my daughter because we see them weekly and she always says hi to the dog. So I sat with my daughter and said essentially \u201cI have something sad to tell you. Today, Puppy died. His body got very old, and he couldn\u2019t see or hear anymore, and his person decided it was time for his body to rest forever. So we\u2019ll keep them both in our thoughts today.\u201d I asked what some of her favorite memories of the dog were, and told her one of mine. We got his owner a card. \nShe asked if the dog would come back, and I said no, his body was gone, and we have our memories of him. She wasn\u2019t particularly upset at the time, and didn\u2019t mention it again. \n\n\nFast forward to yesterday, playing outside at daycare (where I work) and she walks up to me and says \u201cmom, I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d I said \u201coh honey, that sounds like a scary feeling, let\u2019s talk about it.\u201d And she started crying- like really crying, asking if she\u2019s going to die and if I\u2019m going to die. So I said things along the lines of \u201cwe are going to all live really long, healthy lives. The circle of life is that we are born, live long lives, and then when our bodies are very very old, we die. It\u2019s ok to be scared or sad about dying, but you don\u2019t have to worry that it will be soon.\u201d \n\nLast night, same thing again, her dad and I said the same stuff. Once she was calm, we tried to ask her what brought it to mind and she said a friend (age 2) didn\u2019t want to play with her and she felt sad. \n\nToday, during her quiet tv time (little kid stuff, no death) she suddenly started crying again asking if when she died if it was going to be upstairs in her bed, if it was going to be in three days, and if after she died- would she come back to \u201cnormal.\u201d \nI have a great book about loss for kids that continues the message of \u201cit\u2019s sad to lose someone, so we tell stories and look at pictures of them when we miss them.\u201d so I grabbed it and read it to her, and she got even more emotional and didn\u2019t want me to finish it. Her dad came home for lunch and chatted with her/reassured her, and that\u2019s been that for an hour. \n\nHer fears seem to revolve around her own death or mine, and if we\u2019ll come back normal or regular afterwards. She hasn\u2019t asked about the dogs we currently have, or any other people- yet. \n\nThese episodes have happened when she\u2019s tired or overstimulated. She doesn\u2019t cry like this often, is definitely sensitive and emotional, but tears like this are usually only during an epic toddler meltdown. There\u2019s genuine fear and sadness in her face and voice. \n\nMy plan is to keep validating and comforting her when she\u2019s upset, using clear and consistent language\u2026 is there anything else I can do?

The surgeon that ordered the MRI Scan said no to surgery. I'm getting a 2nd opinion in 2 weeks. The 1st MRI I got last year was not as detailed and definitely didn't mention annural tears. I got really worried when I read that. No idea what to do and if this can be surgically fixed or will I be like this for a year.

        "title": "[NF] A Story for My Pastors/Missionary Kids",
        "selftext": "My parents have been and are strong Christians. They are the true believers. True believers in the sense that their belief compels their actions. It is no wonder, in my mind, that Christianity is as popular and as \u201creal\u201d due to people like them. It is through their witness and testimony, that I too, would come to believe in a God. This God is alive and active in our lives, we believe. Christianity would lead me down this path of discovery\u2026 and doubt.\u00a0 Maybe it is the secular mantra of \u201cevidence\u201d and \u201cshow me\u201d that demands I reconcile the Christianity of the Bible, the faith of my parents, with the brute unknown; the experience of existing.\n\nIn a way, I envy the world of certainty in which my parents live their lives. When I was growing up, the communists were always the bad guys, and the Americans the good guys. After all, my father was saved by the truth, brought by well meaning American evangelists. My father\u2019s story is of a humble servant of God. He is an uncomplicated being, living in an uncomplicated world, where \u201cby faith\u201d was all that was needed.\n\nAnd this, fellow travelers, is how I will begin this humble story.\n\nIt was towards the end of the Vietnam war, and my father found himself experiencing the more violent aspects of the war. Prior to this beginning, he has been the target of communists in Vietnam. In a separate event, he was almost collateral damage to American bombs. It is a wonder he survived, as he would find himself stumbling upon minefields upon minefields in the rural parts of Vietnam. The only real advantage he had was his ability to seemingly \u201cblend in\u201d. As a Filipino man, browned skinned, he could \u201cblend in\u201d with the local populace, allowing him reach into places that would have been more difficult for other missionaries (for obvious security reasons).\n\nA word, in tagalog, to describe my father is \u201cpandak.\u201d\u00a0 This is meant as a friendly jib on his lack of height, and the stockiness of his build. He had a handsome smile, friendly demeanor and a fiery oratory voice.\u00a0 He grew up, destined to be a farmer, a humble existence well suited to his upbringing, as evidenced by his calloused and worn hands, his affinity for all things nature, and the weight of tradition.\u00a0 Except that would be a destiny denied him. With God\u2019s calling in his life, and perhaps a sense of adventure, he struck out to places beyond rice fields and the agricultural confines of the world he was born in. The weight of conviction would lead him to many different countries, different cultures, different adventures.\n\n\n\nIt was in this setting he and his missionary friends would hear of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) surrounding Danang.\u00a0 It had become a city under siege: no one gets in or out. This made it difficult to know what was going on there. As the fighting intensified, so did the anxieties and worries of my dad and his colleagues. They prayed for Vietnam. They prayed that God would give them a miraculous win over the communists. But most of all, they remembered the friends that were still in Danang. Local colleagues. Specifically, there was a youth group that my father and another missionary, Pedro (who my dad had near death experiences with, and you could probably guess, was very near and dear to my dad), had co-mentored, and had developed close bonds with.\u00a0 There were rumors that the NVA was executing Christians for being Christians. That even if you had metaphorically dodged a bullet splattering your brains all over the place, the crime of Christianity would mean internment into these re-education camps.\u00a0\n\nIt was in this time of panic, prayer, and pause, Pedro then had a revelation: they should go to Danang. My father, who did not have any suspicions or doubt in God\u2019s divine purpose in their lives, was skeptical of such a message. Of course, this was cause for such consternation.\n\nMy father recounts a scene where Christians are forcibly lined up, a gun placed on their heads, and asked if they believe in God.\u00a0 As they answer in the affirmative, a trigger is pulled, and the explosive force of a 7.62 bullet is driven through their skull, forcing brain and blood on to the pavement. If you ever look at the historical evidence for such a story, the evidence of such a scene is inconclusive. However, very few who experienced the arrival of the NVA and the communists would characterize this encounter as \u201cfriendly.\u201d\n\nKnowing of the dangers posed by the NVA, my dad was against this idea that they should travel to Danag, risking their life on an obviously suicidal mission.\u00a0 HIs friend, Pedro, was otherwise convinced.\u00a0 My father remained unconvinced, but Pedro was his friend. Not just any friend\u2026 best friends. My dad had to convince his best friend that there was another way, and this was a terrible idea borne of desperation, and not God.\u00a0 They went back and forth, till finally, my dad, fed up with this conversation, devised a plan, then told Pedro, \u201cWe all want to God\u2019s will, and if we are to do God\u2019s will, we would need to get advice from the Word of God, thus I will randomly open the Bible, and place my finger upon a verse, and that verse will tell us go to Danag.\u201d For the first time, Pedro, had doubts about the message he had received, but he relented to my dad\u2019s badgering, and used the method of determining God\u2019s will my dad had come up with. The exact passage or where in the Bible my father\u2019s finger landed is forever lost in the annals of time.\n\nThe last flight to Danang was eerily empty.\u00a0 My father and Pedro had bought seats on the last flight out from Saigon. The situation was becoming dire. The airport in Danang was getting overrun; mortars were contesting each plane that made an attempt to land. The way that they got to Danang would not be the way my father and Pedro would leave Danang.\u00a0 My father, when he tells this tale, would always put emphasis on the emptiness of the plane.\u00a0 No one was flying to a city, under siege, because people were getting killed. But any sense of foreboding or self preservation was suppressed by their beliefs, compelling them forward towards destiny.\n\nAs they disembarked from the plane, my dad described to me the absolute chaos of people trying to take advantage of this arrival of the last flight out of Danang.\u00a0 There were so many people trying to get on the plane, space was in short supply. People were trying to bribe the pilots, stewardess, to let them on the plane.\u00a0 People had to leave their luggage and wealth behind.\u00a0 Some, realizing the reality of the situation, bargained for just their kids: they would stay back and find another way out of Danang. They would make it out, maybe.\n\nMy father and his friend made their way to the youth group that was near and dear to them.\u00a0 At first, they were overjoyed: they had made their way through the siege, and surely God had provided them to show them the way out!\u00a0 Then their joy turned to anger: there were no more flights out, and my father and Pedro were going to share their fate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt is during a crisis like this, with death right around the corner, that one contemplates what they would do with what they have left in life with all honesty.\u00a0 My dad was fortunate that he had this moment he could share with a good friend.\u00a0 He and Pedro talked it out, and decided, if it was their time, and they had this little bit of time left, they would do what their purpose in life was: to spread the gospel.\u00a0 It seemed appropriate.\u00a0 For many it meant that this would be the last time a sinner would be able to accept God\u2019s grace.\u00a0 If death was inevitable, then their choice, in life, was to save as many souls here in this place before the violence of communist rule would descend to this place.\n\nWith their decision made up, they struck out, with brochures, called \u201ctracts\u201d that they would share to the people in Danang.\u00a0 Judgement is here, and the only way out was through Christ.\u00a0 The paradise they would speak of would be a stark contrast to the reality of a city under siege.\u00a0 Paradise was paved of gold\u2026 not clogged streets strewn with immobilized vehicles and the stench of dead bodies, unburied.\u00a0 The peacefulness of heaven, not the barrage of artillery and gunfire, ever approaching closer.\u00a0 The joy of communion with God, as opposed to the wails of sorrow of yet another loved one separated, or cut down by war.\u00a0 God\u2019s ways are mysterious, that he would allow for such misery, yet present another reality that is so\u2026 heavenly.\n\nOne cannot fathom God\u2019s plan, but if he had a plan, it was to allow these two Filipino men to walk on to the docks of Danang, with salvation in their hearts.\u00a0 It was here, they noticed a very peculiar sight:\u00a0 a boat with a Filipino flag sailing into the docks.\u00a0 They rushed over, to where the boat was docked, and perhaps this would be some trick of the mind.\u00a0 What was the purpose of a Filipino warship in Danang?\u00a0 Come to find out, it was to evacuate Filipinos and their dependents. Yes. God had ordained a rescue operation that would be actualized through their faith.\n\nQuickly they returned to the place of the youth members, gathering them, for this would be their salvation. There was not a lot of time for sweet goodbyes. They had to leave a lot of things and people behind. They knew, as long as they got out, there would be hope. Pedro, that youth group, my dad. They knew death or internment camp would become their fate. If they could get out, they would tell the world of what is happening inside Danang.\n\nAs before, with the scene of the last flight out of Danang, so too it would repeat itself on this Filipino ship.\u00a0 People begging, crying, throwing babies at the ship, hoping a stranger would bring their child to a better future.\u00a0 The destroyer took on as many people as they could, considering it was a large ocean going vessel, it was jammed back, with this throng of desperate, scared refugees of a war torn country.\n\nThis story ends in Hong Kong. As they disembarked, these fresh refugees of a war, new hope, new opportunities arose.\u00a0 Not long after that, Saigon would fall, and an iron curtain would descend upon Vietnam, cutting off communication with those that were on the other side.\u00a0 It would be years before my dad or Pedro would hear from colleagues and friends who were left in Vietnam. Years later, this youth still remembers my father and Pedro very fondly.\n\nWhen I hear my dad say he believes what he believes\u2026 it takes on a different meaning than when I hear it from churches or other pastors.\u00a0 It is very rare that one puts one\u2019s life on the line for what they believe.\u00a0 It is evidence, very strong, of a testament of that belief.\u00a0 It transcends the platitudes of sending \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d that we are so used to hearing from Christians today.\u00a0 Or to \u201cbring it to God in prayer.\u201d\u00a0 Or the millions of other Christian well wishes that cannot be measured or quantified.\u00a0 The way Christians talk about the God of the Bible that is dead.\u00a0 It is time we reconciled the living God with the reality that we live in.",

I originally posted this in /r/navy, not realizing that their rules exclude people who are already past bootcamp, so that post was locked. Hopefully this isn't deemed a crosspost, since I can't post in /r/navy anymore.\n\nAnyways, I'm potentially facing a separation under some uncommon circumstances. I've tried to find older discussions about similar cases, but most seem to be related to pre-enlistment, or folks with several years of service who experienced some crisis that prompted a closer look into their background.\n\nI enlisted in the Navy without disclosing prior diagnoses of unspecified Bipolar disorder, ADHD, depression, anxiety, plus voluntary psychiatric hospitalization for suicidal ideation, which all occured approx. 2 years ago. \n\nThis was all discovered in my records during bootcamp, and I spent 5 weeks in separations holding because of it. I appealed the separation and ultimately received a general duty w-a-i-v-e-r from the CO of RTC. I returned to training and graduated from RTC without incident, and I'm about 1/3 of the way through my A-school pipeline with >180 of active duty service under my belt.\n\nCouple weeks ago, the security manager called me in, and they had me fill out an entirely new SF-86, on which I have included all of that previously undisclosed information. \n\nI understand that I am almost certainly facing a separation, but I'm hoping that other sailors might be able to chime in with anecdotes and speculate with me about the timeline, the characterization of the discharge, maybe even possible circumstances under which I can see out the rest of my contract, and so on.

        "selftext": "Hello ladies,\n\nI am at my wits\u2019 end, y\u2019all.\n\nIn November of 2023 I had a UTI that turned very quickly into a bladder infection. \n\nA couple of weeks before that, I had unprotected sex with a partner for the first time (we had been having protected sex with condoms and IUD before, and we\u2019re both recently and frequently tested for all the common STI\u2019s which have always come out negative.) I ended up with a yeast infection after that, and I just figured it was a reaction to, you know, new semen.\n\nSince then, so for around a year and a half, I\u2019ve been having alternating UTIs and yeast infections almost monthly, usually right before or during my period. One time I had both at once. One time I also had BV at the same time as a UTI. This can be partially explained by the antibiotics causing the yeast infection, but I\u2019ve been requesting a Diflucan to take because I have a history of that happening. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just the antibiotics messing with my microbiome, and neither does my internist. It also doesn\u2019t usually line up with the timing\u2014I\u2019ll get a yeast infection a month or 6 weeks after antibiotics.\n\nThis is nonstop and it just feels hopeless. My vagina hurts so much that penetrative sex is painful, which is hard on me and my relationships (I\u2019m poly). I can\u2019t use tampons or menstrual cups. My stomach has been ravaged by the antibiotics\u2014they make me throw up when I take them, even with food, and now I\u2019ve been feeling nauseous and sometimes throwing up for two weeks after finishing the latest course. I\u2019m going through Zofran alarmingly fast, taking 1 or 2 doses almost every day. \n\nThe UTI bacteria always tests as not resistant to any antibiotics, so my doc said it\u2019s  very unlikely that this is the same recurring infection that hasn\u2019t been completely killed by the antibiotics. It has tested mostly as E. coli, but a couple times it has been staph.\n\nIn the last couple months, I have managed to get my doctor to prescribe weekly Diflucan just as a preventative so I haven\u2019t been getting yeast infections anymore, thank the gods. \n\nMy Internist did some tests, didn\u2019t find anything obvious and then referred me to a Urologist, suggesting that it might be interstitial cystitis. \n\nThe Urologist shot that down (with no explanation), was generally super dismissive, asked me I had anxiety or was pregnant (no to both, btw), and ran the same tests my internist did, again with nothing solid. He suggested it might be endometriosis or something similar, and ordered an ultrasound of my bladder and uterus/ovaries, which came out normal with no abnormalities. \n\nI\u2019m at the end of my rope, folks. This feels hopeless and I just cry and get super depressed every time I start to feel symptoms of one or the other of these issues. \n\nIt takes months to get appointment with specialists (my gyno appointment is still 2 months out), so I have to keep going to urgent care and they don\u2019t have any solutions except antibiotics and Diflucan, but there HAS to be an underlying issue, doesn\u2019t there? \n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience? Was there any diagnosis or treatment that helped? ",

        "selftext": "So. Writing it out is supposed to help right? \n\nOn Monday I scheduled a vet appointment for my cat, Haven. She's had chronic kidney disease for years now and we've been managing it with food and water supplements. But for the past month or so I've noticed just how skinny she'd gotten. A month is a guess, I don't know how long it's been since I noticed she was so underweight. I've always been trying to get her to eat more, and this put me into overdrive. I found some new foods she liked, some appetite enhancers, I fed her every time she came downstairs not just at meal time, etc. And it seemed to be working. She came down more often, ate more food. I'd hoped it could get her back to a normal weight. But then this weekend. I realized she was still losing weight despite all my efforts. On Sunday, I realized I could feel her ribs and her hips were really prominent. I took note of how she walked, slow and getting dizzy often. How she didn't like to stay in one spot for long unless asleep. How her eyes seemed to be sunken in more (I don't know if that was actually true). How most of her meows were hoarse and quiet. And I knew anything I could do wasn't working. No amount of appetite fixing would change that she wasn't retaining it anymore. I knew the next day I would call the vet, and probably not bring her back. \n\nSo I brought her to her favorite spot (right next to me on the bed, with both my hands giving her pets as we fell asleep for the night, where she has been almost every night for the past 6 years). She got up much faster then she used to (she used to stay there all night) and went to go lay near the heater. And I had a long cry. When I woke up the next morning I thought maybe I was wrong. She could be fine. Maybe we could do this. If she would just eat. But she only had a few licks of wet food, just like the day before, and then she got dizzy by my feet on a 4 foot trek to get water, and I told her I'd call them. And sat on the floor with her crying. She laid so she was flush against my leg, trying to give me comfort, until she got too uncomfortable and went to lay down elsewhere. I figured I'd let her sleep. She was so so tired. All the time. And I couldn't stay on the floor all day crying with the appointment in the afternoon. \n\nWent to work for a half day. Came back early and sat with her by her heater spot, her new favorite spot, in a cloth box where the heater vent was underneath. Spent an hour giving her her favorite pets and talking to her. She purred the whole time and pet me back with her tail. This is how I want to rememeber her. Calm and purring and making a small meow when I first touch her. The other cat closest in age to her tried to go in the pet carrier instead of her, even though he hates it. He sat outside it once she was in and wouldn't move. He must have been able to tell by my incessant crying that something was happening. I heated up the heating pad before putting it in the crate, then a towel that smelled like me, and then her cloth box. So she could take her favorite spot with her. And we left home for the last time. \n\nThis isn't the first pet I've lost like this. My childhood dog was also put down with me there. But my mom and family friend were there too. And they stayed by his head as he went, while I was off to his side. I didn't understand how fast it would be. I'd gotten out of the way for the vet and gave them some space, pet his side, and then it was over. I feared for the longest time that he didn't know I was there and that I loved him. And it took a very. Very. Long time to come to terms with any of that. So I went alone. I wanted her to know for sure I was there. I wish I'd brought someone with me. Someone who would've advocated for me when I was too much a mess to do anything right. Someone to hug me after. \n\nI drove to the vet with one hand in her carrier, her laying on top of it. It used to be she'd meow the whole way, until I put my hand in or let her sit in the chair. This time she was silent. I pet her in the waiting room, sticking my hand inside the carrier until we were called. I pet her in the office room, looking at her from the opening of the carrier, crying before the vet even made it in. \n\nI brought her food with me, hoping by some miracle of medicine that they'd be able to get her to eat, but not really believing it. They had me sit in the chair a ways away and then examined her. And they came to the same conclusion as me, that at some point you have to start thinking about 'quality of life' rather then how long you've got. She was so tired. And so quiet. Since the moment I adopted her 6 years ago, she's almost always been making little meows at me. It's why I'd picked her from the shelter in the first place. \n\nThey said I could take her home and hope for a miracle. Or take her home and bring her back later to put her down. Or... But I knew what this appointment was for, even if I'd told the receptionist it was a 'check up' and emailed to ask the vet if we could do bloodwork to figure out the problem. But I asked her if she thought it would help. And she shook her head. \n\nI do have a reason for not taking those offers, though I regret not being selfish now. Maybe Haven would've wanted more time, even painful time. But I don't know... I watched my Grandma die earlier this year. They knew she was going to go in the morning and called the whole family in. And it wasn't until nearly 5pm that she passed. She had to wait, asking me for help until she fell asleep, leaning against my side even though it looked uncomfortable, until my cousin put her upright, without the proper hospice meds because they hadn't arrived yet. They never arrived. I held her hand and waited with her. But it was cruel that she had to sit around in pain, waiting for one of her organs to finally fail. Surrounded by family trying to talk about something else, with only me staring at her as she took her last breath. It wasn't kind. I didn't want that for Haven. Not when I could give her something else. I didn't want her to have to wait like that, even if it was at home. \n\nI keep remembering her in the vet's arms as I'm sobbing in the chair agreeing to put her down, and I'm wishing I'd been the one holding her. That was the last time she was calm before the meds kicked in. She was watching me, quiet, as I said no to more time with her. As I tried not to be selfish and to let her go peacefully. I thought I'd done my grieving the day before and then. I thought I'd come to terms with it. \n\nThey took her away to put the IV in and she was quiet. She always used to meow the whole time the techs had her, I could always hear her through the doors. But right then all I had was my stuttering breathes and sniffles. They asked if I had questions, I thought I didn't. I'd been there for my dog.They took me to another room that was more comfortable. And I laid out the towel I'd put in the carrier, the one that smelled like me. Cats are supposed to know smells right? When they brought her in she was fine in their arms. But I didn't hold her. She always hated that (especially these later years when it was probably less comfortable). She was just too tired to object to the techs. We put her on the towel instead. \n\nBut she didn't want me to hold her there either. She kept trying to jump over my shoulder or off the table or on the carrier. She's always hated needles (I learned this from having to give her subcutaneous fluids for a time), and the iv made her want to get away from her own leg, and by extension me. I really tried to calm her down, but she didn't want to. In my grief ridden state now, I anthropomorphize that she didn't want to die. That she was trying to get away so they wouldn't put her down. But logically, I know it was just the IV in her leg that kept her anxious. She acted the same way when the fluid needle was in. But I still feel guilty. \n\nWhen the vet asked if I was ready, I said I'd hoped she'd calm down more before we started. I wanted to hold her like I used to when playing video games. I'd have my arms crossed infront of us both, with her head on my arm and her held against my chest, but her body on the table. And she said the first step usually helps with that. \n\nI think she misunderstood me. I was thinking the first step would be a light sedation, a precursor to a larger one. Because when I agreed and she started, Haven lost all muscle control and collapsed slowly. That wasn't what I'd wanted. I wanted her to calm down so that I could hold her, not for her to be paralyzed (I realize now that it's the 'relaxation' drug. But at the time all I could think about was that she couldn't move. Had to just wait for us to do anything. And the whole point was I didn't want her to wait). Her tongue was sticking out, I don't think I've ever seen her tongue in the time I've known her. I couldn't hold her the way I wanted to because she was laying flat now. \n\nI panicked, honestly. If she was paralyzed she couldn't tell me if something hurt, couldn't communicate with me. I didn't know our last moments together would be me trying to hold her and her trying to get away, before she couldn't do anything anymore. And I didn't want her to feel trapped, so when the vet asked about the next step, told her yes. As much as I wanted to talk to her and I tried, I didn't want her stuck like this for longer than necessary. I wasn't going to sit there and make her wait. Even if I wasn't ready. Of course I'd never been ready. I laid her head down so it wasn't on me (I was worried there would be pressure on her throat that she couldn't communicate? I donno. Like I said, I was panicking), and I pet her in her favorite spot. And cried so loud she probably heard me even through the meds. \n\nAnd then it was over. And she's gone now. I wish I'd been selfish. Not in more days, I can't regret her not having to spend more time in pain. I don't know what she would've wanted, I had to guess. But I wish I'd been selfish in the room with her. Asked for more time before we started. Waited for her to calm down on her own, even if the vet had been inconvenienced waiting. (I'm always making rash decisions so I don't bother others. Especially when I'm panicking). Because she's gone now. And I messed up another loss, just in a different way this time. And I know that she'd forgive me that, because she loved me. If she'd been conscious enough for long enough to realize what was happening. But I still feel so guilty anyway. It went so fast. And it's my fault it did. I don't blame the vet, she didn't do anything without asking me. I was the one who panicked. Who didn't ask the right questions. Who rushed along because all I could think about was how my Grandma had to wait. And I loved her too much to let that happen. I'm still the same idiot. \n\nI keep remembering her with her tongue out, a position she'd never willingly be in, and the moments of trying to hold her and her trying to get away, of the vet holding her when she's calm, of crying when I should've been over there petting her too. and I feel like I failed again. Did I rememeber incorrectly how long it'd been since she ate properly? Did I lie to the vet and put her down too soon? Or did I wait too long to take her in? Wait so long there was nothing they could do anymore? Either way it feels like I killed her. That I wasn't comforting enough like she deserved. And there's nothing to do with these feelings because she's gone now. And she's been gone for days. \n\nSorry this is so long. I'm hoping typing it all out will help me process it and feel better. Even if it's been 48 hours and I'm still crying at least once an hour. Including right now. ",

        "selftext": "About a month ago - although it feels like just yesterday - my partner passed away after he spent his very last days of his life in emotional turmoil because of our relationship. In this relationship, I was struggling a lot with trust, feelings of low self esteem, and I constantly questioned his love for me. None of this is his fault. They existed before him but somehow I projected this onto him, and it manifested in moodiness. I realize now, although it\u2019s too late, I should\u2019ve gotten help. \n\nOur back story: I met him two years ago, after a drunken night out. I was freshly out of a long term relationship. We hooked up, and then talked after that time and we hung out. Pretty early on I saw this side of him come out that I didn\u2019t understand. It was a mix of meanness and idk someone who can see right through you and point out your flaws. After our second hang out he really didn\u2019t leave my place. I was lonely and enjoyed his company. That is how our relationship started, a few weeks in I realize that he has a drinking problem. That\u2019s what caused the mood swings and the drunk him was pretty upfront. The first year of our relationship I ran around trying to save him ( idk who I thought I was). One of his verbal attacks that caused the most pain was when I said to him, \u201cPlease be better stop drinking why are you fucking up your life,\u201d he turned and said to me \u201cyou\u2019re a fuck up, your life is a disaster, you have debt, unpaid rent, you\u2019re angry.\u201d Instead of focusing on the disaster of my life, I tried to fix his. I was deeply attached by this point. He would drink and binge for days. \n\nWhen he came to he was a deeply sensitive, good, kind person. We officially moved in. I asked him to move in. I asked for him to get a job. That job hunt took a very long time. That first year I started therapy again, I pushed him to go to rehab and he would go, then (stupidly and sadly and selfishly) we would say we missed each other and he would come home, partly because I said I didn\u2019t know if I could wait 3 months. So he ran home to me. And immediately after he got out he would drink again.  \n\nI started therapy, I had really bad suicidal thoughts. Him being in my apartment and drinking and drinking made me feel sad for my life. Every time he would binge I would kick him out of the apartment. I would then  look for him and call him back and that was the cycle for the first year. The reason why I would kick him out is because he would hide bottles and lie about how much he was drinking. Lie to my face. In therapy I would talk about my distrust of him and how it had been a year and there was no job. My friends would encourage me to leave him and I just didn\u2019t. I trusted he would start working soon but of course I felt resentful. My therapist would ask why it would take months to find a job. When I brought this up to him he would say he was trying.\nFast forward a year from then, I move and I take this as an opportunity to question if we should stay together, he insists he\u2019s trying. I don\u2019t write him on the lease but just feel lonely and convince myself he\u2019ll get a job. He does get a job and starts paying rent. He also finds an outpatient program and his binges lessen by a lot. \n\nAnd now, is the where the bad comes in. As he\u2019s trying. My inner stories about him get stronger, I start believe he\u2019s obsessed with his ex partner for some reason. And it causes mood changes in me. I withdraw from him sometimes. I question his love for me. Although he tells me almost everyday he loves me. I just don\u2019t feel it. He doesn\u2019t plan dates, buy me gifts, or compliments me. Once he starts making money he does slowly start taking me out. But it\u2019s only when our relationship is perfect - which i understand now meant he wanted a good stable relationship. Our sex life was pretty amazing though. If he had a problem with anything I did, he would shut down and I have to dig it out of him. I also have to mention his sense of humor in the beginning of the year was different for me. I felt it was a bit of bullying.  When he\u2019s in therapy he tells his therapist (this from him) that sometimes I pick up on his mood changes, but he just doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. His therapist replies with you might be gaslighting her. So he asked me to point out when this is happening. \n\nI develop extremely bad coping habits the second year. Sometimes to intentionally hurt him after I feel unloved. If we had an argument and he didn\u2019t talk to me I would leave the apartment to go out to clubs. Very stupid. I didn\u2019t want to be there at all but in my head since he didn\u2019t talk to me it made it ok (so stupid). This is what caused his binges the second year. After the binges we would talk and have these deep conversations and start over. Things were escalating so much these past months. Sometimes he was quiet and i interpreted that as a mood swing or him being angry with me. I never gave the guy space. Small things would trigger both of us.\n\nI also pick up another abusive habit. I start taking the keys from him after arguments. This makes him very angry and sad. I do it ( sickly ) to gain control and to avoid him being in apartment or having access to it in case he drinks. \n\nThe second year his binges are only triggered by our fights. If I do something stupid like leave after an argument I come home to find him wasted. When we talk he would say to me I\u2019m just hurt and it\u2019s how I cope. \n\nI can give you example of the times he binged.\n\nI have really bad ocd and was controlling af. I also have dog. We had different work schedules so he would be home when I was gone. I I had super bad trust issues not only because of drinking but because of my own self worth. I had this camera out he knew about it but didn\u2019t know I was running it. And one day I\u2019m running late and ask him to bring my dog out. My dog is still young and I see this on camera - she starts running around and he flips her with the leash and then she cries. She develops this problem where sometimes when she sees him she pees. It makes me upset and I confront him about the footage I saw. He apologizes and says he knows he crossed the line.  One time we come home and she has a little accident there\u2019s also water on the floor. I say that I\u2019m pissed that she\u2019s peeing, I\u2019m really angry that I have to suck it in and he hasn\u2019t done squat to make my dog feel comfortable around him after what had happened. He denies it\u2019s pee and I pick up the pee and show him up close it is. He then turns and picks up the water and says it\u2019s not pee. He puts the napkin even closer to my face. In turn I pick up the pee and say to myself I can\u2019t let him get away with this and pick up the pee and put it in his face too. He then turns and shoves me against the wall and with the napkin smushes my face with napkin. I\u2019m shocked but I know I also retaliated. I ask him to leave and binge starts again. To be fair to him I had also gotten physical before, one time the first year we came home after a night out - before knowing the severity of his drinking problem - and I got out of the uber and when I turned he wasn\u2019t there. While in the uber he was having a nice even flirty chat with the driver - at least it\u2019s what my brain said. So once he walks in I ask him to leave and he doesn\u2019t and I get physical and punch him. I know I\u2019m an abuser. \n\nHe was a quiet guy and that caused discomfort in me for whatever reason. So stupid. At his best he was loving, loved to cook, loved to spend time with me and in those moments I felt totally in love and behaved. He would say to me, \u201cIf you behave I don\u2019t binge. And you can be you and have your moments it is when you attack the relationship that I feel sad and then drink and drink and push it because I know you want it to be over.\u201d\n\nAlmost every time we fought I would threaten to end things. He just sat there and took it. \n\nBefore this last binge, there was another one that lasted a few days. This one was also caused by me, although strangely I also was able to clearly see we both had bad patterns. \n\nI had bought a car, I was getting busy with work, and he was also working. I asked him to come help me and he said he was busy. It was strange. Little by little he withdrew and I panicked- our relationship while good had constant communication. And suddenly he changed things. He was  taking long to reply to texts. He was distant. I tried to ignore it at first and even went so far as to buy him some sweet treat he liked so he could be happy. Nothing worked. He went to see a friend and didn\u2019t tell me about it. I confronted him and then he said there was no reason for me to get to the point where I wanted to end things if he didn\u2019t share his whereabouts. He didn\u2019t lie just didn\u2019t share. That night we slept in bed together. I took his phone - and ran out of the apartment with it. Truly, I didn\u2019t think I would find anything I wanted (because of my retroactive jealous) wanted to see pictures of his exes. I didn\u2019t find anything and went back home. When I got to the apartment he was already drinking and it started a binge. When he came to and I asked why he withdrew from me he said that he felt unappreciated, when I asked for help at work he explained he felt like his time wasn\u2019t appreciated. Everything made sense. So we were good until we weren\u2019t. \n\nValentine\u2019s Day comes around I feel so happy. We\u2019re in a good place after that binge. He works with me that day and then we go our separate ways. We exchange phones he had no service and needed a phone for a job.  Again me and my sickness want to go through his phone, to see what I can find about his past. I know I\u2019m sick. From there I don\u2019t find anything but I do find porn. When he comes to meet me he has this happy face that will forever haunt me. Earlier he had also made plans, very lightly touched on the subject of wanting to get dinner (it was Valentine\u2019s Day). While he\u2019s gone my head is going crazy and feeling low because of the porn I saw. I thought we were good so why should he be watching porn. Stupid me. I confront him and he says you\u2019re crazy it\u2019s not mine. He only calls me crazy after I keep pushing. There\u2019s this back and forth I\u2019m crying and I also see he got me no Valentine\u2019s Day gift. I cry like an idiot. His response is he did try but they were out of flowers. He sits quietly while I talk and cry and accuse him of being a bad bf. He says that in his previous relationship he wasn\u2019t breaking up and making up all the time. After his I apologize and say to him let\u2019s go get food. He\u2019s now in a mood but says ok. There\u2019s a bit of tension when he pushes me to decide what I want. After this we pick up some street food. I have to go back to work\u2019s and can\u2019t spend the night at home. When I leave I say I will stop by tomorrow morning to spend time with him.\nI get to work and then feel off just sad, the dinner I guess wasn\u2019t enough. I go back and forth and say to him maybe he should go to rehab and we should take this time apart. He replies not fully engaging but agreeing he does feel tired of my mood swings. Next day comes around I have a drs appointment and decide to not show up to our apartment during my work break. I just didn\u2019t feel it.\nMidday comes and I just say to to myself  let\u2019s surprise him now. I walk in and find him walking in with a huge bottle of vodka. He has this shocked face and says to me this is partly your fault. I cry and he asks me to stop crying and take accountability. I just wanted to blame him I guess. \n\nThis whole time he\u2019s in the apartment I have to go back to work and can\u2019t spend time at home. So the crazy in me the ocd and the controlling part keep intensifying. I see he\u2019s walking around drunk in the apartment. Dogs and cats aren\u2019t allowed in the room and they\u2019re in there. I feel out of control unable to do much. I make a plan that I\u2019ll come home and get him out. Even if it has to be physical. I know I\u2019m abusive. I wish I could turn back time and do it differently. I get to the apartment and he\u2019s wasted. I ask him to leave ( so stupid to do, you can\u2019t reason with a drunk person). I say if you don\u2019t leave I\u2019m calling the cops. He doesn\u2019t care. I then look for my car keys. He had been borrowing a car for work. Also previous binges when I kicked him out he would sleep on the street. I know I\u2019m cruel but I couldn\u2019t be around the drunk him anymore. He whims constantly lie about the drinking. Something catches my eye and I notice car key is gone. I panick because car isn\u2019t under my name but my parents. Also, during his binges he would sometimes have accidents so as stupid as it sounds that was a worry of mine. I confront him and he denies having taken the key. This sends me into a rage and I push him and hit him. I\u2019m so ashamed of this. He has no reaction. I then grab a blade and threaten to hurt myself. He takes it away and passes out in bed. I leave. Next day I call police and he finally leaves. When I step out I look for car and it\u2019s parked where it should\u2019ve been. I doubt my own intuition that he took key but when I check he is in there. I tell him to give me key and he says it\u2019s not there. I leave, and we\u2019ll part  of me at that point did want out if the relationship. I tell myself that I\u2019ll just let things be and not like before where I would chase him to bring him home. Next day comes around and it\u2019s a hot day. He comes home to get his wallet. I ask him for key and he doesn\u2019t give it. He\u2019s still in a drunk state I believe. Something in me refused to fight for key. I accept my fate. He walks away. Two days pass and I don\u2019t check on him. I want to move forward with my life. I force myself not to. \n\nThere\u2019s a friend who was trying to get him to rehab in exchange he wound he paid for it. That friend comes a few days later and I tell him where car is parked. I get a frantic call and I run out of the apartment. My bf is dead. He\u2019s purple and stiff. I couldn\u2019t believed it. The man I loved so much and hurt so much was gone. There was no life left in him. He had drank himself to death. I kept hearing his worlds replay in my head, when you end things with me I just keep drinking and drinking.\n\n\nI have so many regrets. I wish I could take back all the ways in which I hurt him. There were many. I wish I would\u2019ve told him how much I loved him. Although I did often, very often. I wanted more and more of him. He only gave me what he could and I was never satisfied. Side story he had struggled for a very long time with addiction. When he met me it was the first attempt at rehab. He had also told me that it was the first time he had fallen in love. For some reason it was difficult for me to believe this.\n\nSince his death I\u2019m plagued with thoughts of ending things. He was such a gentle soul. I let my demons win. I embraced my crazy side and now he\u2019s dead. I\u2019ve done drugs to try and connect to him ( so stupid, I know) and there\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m feeling so ashamed. I want to be with him now. I don\u2019t deserve to be alive if he\u2019s gone. He was trying and I kept pushing and pushing. \n\n\nSay it all to me. Please. Wish me dead. And maybe I can finally go for it. ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m wondering if anybody else has dealt with/is dealing with really severe physical symptoms after their loved one\u2019s suicide? For the first few months after my mom killed herself, I had to clear out a 2600 sq ft house, sell it, find a home for her cats, pack up all the stuff I kept, then move back home 3,000 miles away. So I was in ultra utilitarian mode and I feel like adrenaline prevented me from actually feeling anything (physically OR emotionally). \n\nI\u2019m back home now, though, and my body is completely deteriorating. I had a sciatica flare up several weeks ago and I was unable to walk for eight days. I was stranded on my mattress that whole time. I couldn\u2019t even get to the bathroom to pee. I hadn\u2019t been able to eat for over a week at that point, so luckily I didn\u2019t end up laying in shit. Just piss. I had to spend $800 getting a new mattress delivered when I was finally able to walk again.\n\nWhenever I try to eat, I often vomit almost immediately. I am so fatigued I can\u2019t stand for longer than two minutes without practically collapsing. My joints ache with excruciating pain, all day, every day. I want to spend time with friends and do the things that will help me move forward, but I can\u2019t, simply because my body won\u2019t let me. I know \u2728the body keeps score\u2728 and this is likely a physical response to immense trauma, but I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m only 31, so these symptoms seem unusual for my age.\n\nIf anybody else has experienced something similar, what did you do to recover?",

        "title": "I Discovered a Parallel Reality where Dinosaurs Never went Extinct.. Part 2",
        "selftext": "Out of the plains and into the woods. I was now traveling through a dense mosaic of conifers. The trees towering above me, baring an uncanny resemblance to the sequoias in California. \n\nNow I just needed to figure out where my uncle was, that is, if he had even settled here. I didn\u2019t stray too far from the stream, if there was any sign of somebody living here, i\u2019d imagine they\u2019d be close to water. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that everything in this version of Earth felt, bigger. The plants, the animals, simply the overall scale of this reality, it was enormous. \n\nThe hulking trees towered above me like buildings. Emanating from the canopy were the sounds of various birds, many of which sounded like nothing i\u2019d ever heard before. The forest floor was blanketed in groves of ferns, primeval in appearance. \n\nWhile continuing my way upstream, I regularly kept a sharp eye out for anything manmade. Some of the trees had massive; gaping holes in them, not dissimilar to the redwood forests of the pacific coast in our own timeline. I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d make an ideal place to camp out, although probably not for twenty years. While thinking about it, I came to a complete stop. \n\nNow I don\u2019t know what it was at the time, but something didn\u2019t sit right. I could feel a presence, not of an animal, no. This felt very different. \n\nSomething, or someone, was watching me. \n\nYet no matter where I looked, there was nothing. It\u2019s as if the trees themselves had eyes. \n\nPerhaps I was just on edge. I brushed it off, albeit reluctantly, and continued about my business. \n\nI followed the stream for what seemed like hours, but to no avail, did I find any sign of human presence. That, unexpectedly, would soon change. \n\nRight away, I caught a glimpse of something odd on the bark of a tree. The discovery of which piqued my curiosity. \n\nI went in for a closer look, and when I did, my eyes widened. Carved into the trunk of this conifer was some sort of image. The image looked like some sort of crest or sigil, circular with three points emerging on top. My best guess was that it was a flame. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t a doubt in my mind, this had to have been carved by my uncle. He must\u2019ve left this for me to find him. \n\nBelieving I was getting closer, I rushed back to the path down the stream without haste, I knew he had to be close by. Up ahead I could see a clearing, could this have been it? \n\nI emerged from the trees to find a pond ending at a small waterfall; the remainder of the stream now leading into the mountains. Unfortunately, there was no sign of any settlement. \n\nI was so certain though. He has to be in the vicinity, who else could\u2019ve carved that emblem? \n\n Exhausted, I decided to stop once more and head down to the water\u2019s edge for another drink. I crouched over and scooped up handfuls of water, guzzling it. I wasn\u2019t alone however. \n\nOut from the brush about 5 animals, one adult and 4 infants, appeared and treaded on down to the edge of the pond on the other side. They were similar to a pig in stature, but possessed a beak similar to a parrot\u2019s. \n\nInstinctively, I pulled out the notebook and cassette player, #4 referring me to the creature. \n\n*Part of the ceratopsid family; the horned dinosaurs, Choerumimus scrofa, the Hogbird, is a small forest-dwelling herbivore. It scours the forest floor, gorging on woody plants, bark, and roots. A shy animal, it is named for its similarities in behavior to wild pigs.* \n\nSeemingly a mother and offspring, they proceeded to the water for a drink. Not even seeming to acknowledge my existence. \n\nAside from the hogbirds and myself, it didn\u2019t seem like there was much activity at the pond. \n\nIn fact; things felt a little too quiet. \n\nThe sounds of the birds that filled the forest earlier had now ceased. It all felt suspicious. \n\nUnanticipatedly, the tree adjacent to the hogbird family, it\u2026moved. No, that was no tree. With a lightning fast reaction a massive bill shot down and grabbed one of the younger animals. The screaming infant struggled, calling out in fear, as a massive giraffe-like animal, with the head of a stork shook it violently. The other hogbirds fled, jetting off into the woods. The giant creature lifted its head back, and swallowed its catch whole. I swore I could see it go down the gullet. \n\nThis..thing, it was terrifying. Legs like stilts, a long, slender neck, and dark, reddish eyes that gave off a look of insatiable hunger. \n\nThen I realized. - I\u2019ve seen this animal before. It was the one from the petroglyphs engraved into the rock bluff. Could one of them some time ago have crossed over into our universe? \n\nIt then strided off into the woods. Lucky for me, it seemed it\u2019d had its fill. \n\nI picked up the notebook, and next to #7, was a sketch that vaguely resembled the petroglyphs. I skipped ahead on the cassette player to listen. \n\n*Messoropteryx daemoniensis; the Wood Reaper is a gargantuan pterosaur the size of a giraffe; and the apex predator of the conifer forests. They descend from the Ahzdarchids of the Late Cretaceous, a group that includes the famous \u2018Quetzalcoatlus\u2019, but have given up flight all together to become ground-based hunters. Utilizing ambush, their dark brown coloration allows them to blend into the forest, remaining motionless for unsuspecting prey to walk by, and then striking it with their massive bill. Prey is often swallowed whole, much like a stork or heron.* \n\nThe fact these things stand motionless, pretending to be trees made me all the more terrified. To think one of them actually wandered through that portal into our reality. I could only imagine what the people who encountered this thing felt. \n\nNot wanting to stick around with that stork-monster about, I decided to leave. \n\nI still had no lead on the location of my uncle. At this point it was starting to feel hopeless. But given the carving on the tree though, he had to be somewhere in the forest. Was he even still alive? \n\nThen another possibility came to me - higher ground. Perhaps he decided to set up camp on one of the mountain slopes, away from the dangers down below. Come to think of it, the waterfall had been flowing from higher elevation. Anybody living up there would likely have easy access to drinking water. \n\nI changed course and headed for the foothills of the mountain. \n\nI would first need to rejuvenate before I did, so I decided to stop and rest yet again. Up ahead, what looked like a barren tree seemed ideal. Without hesitation, I walked over and rested my arm on the trunk; a decision I would come to regret.. \n\nThe tree, within seconds of physical contact, moved. Of course it wasn\u2019t a tree, how was I that stupid? \n\nI looked up to see the ravenous glare of a wood reaper. The beast let out a deep bellow like some giant demonic goose, and thrusted its head downward. I barely moved out of the way, as it missed me by several inches. \n\nFast as I could I made a break for it, plowing through the endless patches of ferns. As I ran I could hear the reaper giving chase. It\u2019s freakishly long legs drumming the ground behind me. The damn thing was literally galloping. \n\nWith rapid thinking I made some sharp turns, which gave me a little more distance. I kept running, focusing on getting away with my life. To my misfortune, I hit a dead end - a flat wall of rock too vertical to climb. \n\nAs I turn to face my pursuer, I could see it, creeping around the corner of a tree, gradually closing in on me. Before I knew it this thing was no more than 3 meters away. \n\nThe reaper raised its head to strike, but out of nowhere, an object collided with its head; exploding on impact. A swarm of wasps was now marauding the creature, stinging it in vulnerable areas. The reaper let out a painful bellow, running off into the forest in agonizing pain.\n\nFor a moment; things went silent. I just witnessed a wasp nest get chucked at a giant murder-bird. It had to have been thrown\u2026by somebody. \n\nI looked up in all directions - no sign of anybody around, but as I did, something jumped down from behind me. \n\nWhen I turned around, I was greeted to a small creature, one that resembled a giant owl - but with arms, and a tail. It was roughly chest-high. \n\nThe most insane deatail; several pieces of jewelry hung around its neck. There was no mistake, whatever this thing was, it was sapient. \n\nThe hairy, or moreso feathered creature strutted over to me, not out of malice, but curiosity. It turned its head rapidly several times in a manor just like a bird, analyzing me up close. \n\nUnexpectedly, another one darted out from behind me, this one instead possessing a harness of some sort, that held a pouch against its chest. It too came up to study me. \n\nThe two of them circled me, eager to know what this strange skin-creature before them was. \n\nAfterwards, they congregated in front of me, making a series of chirps, hisses, and grunts to one another, no doubt their language. For about 5 minutes they \u2018spoke\u2019 to each other. Until eventually they looked at me, gesturing with their heads. One didn\u2019t have to be a linguist to understand that they wanted me to follow them. \n\nNeither of them acted truly aggressive toward me. Could my uncle have been living with these creatures? I felt I might stand a better chance of finding him if I came with, thus, I fell in line behind my two escorts. \n\nThe two \u2018birdmen\u2019 led me around the foothills of the mountain, circling the steep, purportedly unclimbable walls of rock. The more I looked at them, the more intrigued I became - could dinosaurs really have evolved society in this universe? Or even civilization? \n\nNaturally, the notebook must\u2019ve contained the answer to such a question. \n\nI opened it on the go, and there at #8 was a sketch reminiscent of my guides. I reached for the cassette player and started the next recording. \n\n*In a world without humans, non-avian dinosaurs would take up the mantle as a sapient species. This would lead to the development of the \u2018Ornithoids\u2019. Descending from a lineage of dinosaurs known as \u2018Thescelosaurids\u2019, a group of small, fast moving herbivores known in the fossil record for their burrowing habits, they have now entered a Stone Age, utilizing both stone and wooden tools for their everyday affairs. Their anatomy has drastically changed, once possessing a roadrunner-like appearance, they now have a build very similar to a burrowing owl; standing in a semi-upright gait, with arms possessing dexterous wrists. Living high up on mountain slopes, they venture down into the forest below only to forage for fruits, nuts and insects. Benign entities; their customs forbid acts of violence, baring life-threatening situations. I myself was able to befriend a tribe established along the slopes of what in our world is the Guadalupe Mountain Range, over time earning their trust. For a time, I lived amongst them, learning their ways, understanding how they perceived the world around them. Both of our realities occur at the same time, suggesting that the Ornithoids were able to avoid many of the mistakes humanity had made. The environment around them still flourished, a stark contrast to what\u2019s happening in our own timeline.* \n\nNot only was there an advanced society of dinosaurs in this version of our own world, but, they were peaceful, reasonable beings. On top of it all, I finally knew where my uncle had been these past two decades. \n\nI looked up to notice that the two Ornithoids escorting me stopped in their tracks. We were at a steep slope of jagged rocks. Both of them looking up towards the peak. The first one extended its legs and lifted off the ground, leaping onto the rocks; almost like a bird taking off. I watched them grip the rocks tightly scaling the near-vertical surface like it was nothing. \n\nMy other companion looked at me, gesturing me to continue following them. He led me towards a walkable, but treacherous ledge. Each step I took was carefully calculated, I mean, imagine coming all this way just to fall to your doom.. \n\nIt took a good 45 minutes, but upon arrival, we stood at the foot of a wall of vegetation, hanging down its face was a collection of vine-like plants. My feathered escort ran toward the wall, disappearing into the green. It was apparently a hidden passage of sorts. Without a second thought I went after them, taking me into what looked like a cave, but there was a light around the corner. I scaled the semi-steep path, and when I got to the end, there it was. \n\nA whole village of them nestled on the side of the mountain, overlooking the entire valley. Dozens of ornithoids were living here; their homes looked like hordes of branches and sticks weaved together, much like a birds\u2019 nest. \n\nMy presence was soon made evident, as many of them now fixated their attention on me. A reaction that was somewhat warranted, for as far as I knew, they\u2019ve only ever seen one other human, who was almost certainly here. Realizing that fact, I was anxious to finally see him. \n\nThe two individuals that led me here appeared before me, and again gestured to me to follow them. The three of us came upon the largest of the \u2018nest houses\u2019 at the center of the village, from the \u2018doorway\u2019 hung all sorts of woven ornaments. \n\nOnce inside, there, sat atop what looked like a large nest, was an ornithoid with much darker gray plumage, their arms folded against their chest like wings. Atop their head was a crown of ornamental vegetation sewn together, and around their neck hung all sorts of vivid jewelry. Obviously, this individual was the village leader or chief. \n\nThe two that led me here approached the old-timer, squawking and chirping up a storm. With a guttural hiss, they were silenced by their elder, who then gestured to them, signaling the pair to leave. \n\nAfter they exited the hut, the old, birdlike figure rose from their nest, and slowly approached, until they were right in front of me. \n\nWhat happened next, I never saw coming.. \n\n\u201cIt would seem you\u2019ve found yourself in quite the predicament, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI was completely speechless. In a surprising twist of events the village chief spoke to me - in perfect English. His voice very similar to a raven or parrot, but much deeper and more reserved. \n\n\u201cH-how, do you know my language, and more importantly how can you speak it?\u201d I asked. \n\nThe chief looked at me, knowing i\u2019d be surprised. \n\n\u201cAstonishing as it may seem, you are not the first otherworldly mammalian we\u2019ve encountered. Our kind has a unique ability to \u2018imitate\u2019 the sounds we hear.\u201d \n\nI was confident I knew who he was referring to. \n\n\u201cI apologize if my grandchildren caused you any trouble on the way here.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot at all\u201d I replied. \n\n\u201cIn fact, they saved my life.\u201d\n\nWanting to know more about this \u2018other human\u2019, I asked. \n\n\u201cYou mentioned somebody else like me. Who were they\u201d? \n\nTo which he replied:\n\n\u201cMany seasons ago another one of your kind came to our lands. While cautious at first, we realized they posed no threat. In accordance to our ways, we take the time to understand that which is unknown to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cFear, is the path to ignorance.\u201d He stated. \n\n\u201cWe took them in, taught them our ways, learned everything we could from them.\u201d \n\nThe chief then looked me directly in the eye. \n\n\u201cWhat is your name stranger\u201d? \n\n\u201cMy name is Henry.\u201d I told him. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come here looking for Dr. Carl Wilkinson.\u201d \n\nThe chief looked at me in shock. There was a look of sorrow in his eyes. \n\n\u201cI had long anticipated your arrival, Henry. I had known for a time that this day would come.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d? I asked. \n\nHis head hung, looking as if a tragedy had just occurred. \n\n\u201cCome my boy, there\u2019s something I must show you..\u201d \n\nThe Chief led me outside, we walked through the village until we reached a cavern, into which we entered. \n\nOnce inside, there was a whole row of mounds, the corridor illuminated by a set of torches. Each had a wooden staff protruding from their center. Mounted at the top of the poles were the skulls of assorted ornithoids. Clearly this was a crypt. \n\n\u201cThese are the halls of our deceased.\u201d Explained the chief. \n\n\u201cOnce we pass on, we are laid to rest here.\u201d \n\nThe skulls, inferred to be from the individuals buried in each plot, were the most interesting part, no doubt a part of their culture. \n\n\u201cWith respect, may I ask why it is that you display the skulls of your dead in this manner\u201d? \n\n\u201cThat is how we honor their memory. And so that their spirits can return to this realm to commune with their kin.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe dead..talk to you\u201d? \n\n\u201cNot in the way you may think.\u201d He explained. \n\n\u201cTo commune with the fallen, one must be attuned to their surroundings, and learn to listen to the land.\u201d \n\nI was never a religious guy, but I was amazed at how complex their culture was. 66 million years of evolution, and dinosaurs have not only continued to thrive, but have evolved advanced ways of life, much like humanity did, only without any of the horrific events that occurred in our own timeline. At least as far as I knew.. \n\nWe walked to the far end of the crypt. Atop the staff - was a human skull. \n\n\u201cCarl was an intelligent and benevolent soul. And he was a good friend.\u201d \n\nThe chief turned to face me. \n\n\u201cI am..terribly sorry.\u201d \n\nI had no words. After all this time searching, the man I came for\u2026was gone.\n\nI dropped to my knees. A feeling of emptiness engulfed me. I had no idea why. I hardly knew Carl, we practically never saw each other, so why? Why did I feel this way. \n\nThe chief put his scaly hand on my shoulder. \n\n\u201cIn the time he lived here, Carl had been planning for seasons, waiting for your arrival, to share this place with you. Share what he learned with one of his own. Once accomplished, he was to accompany you back to your realm.\u201d \n\nGiven what I\u2019d heard from his recordings, all he wanted, was for somebody to believe him this whole time. I at first merely dismissed him as a quiet, bizarre man who never made time for family. But all these years, he wanted to come home. \n\nI got up, and looked at my uncle\u2019s mounted skull, wishing I could talk to him. Then I turned to face the chief to ask another question. \n\n\u201cHow did he die\u201d? \n\nThe elderly birdman was quiet at first, but then spoke. \n\n\u201cHe was felled\u2026at the hands of the scorched.\u201d \n\nThe scorched? Who did he mean exactly? \n\nHe continued: \n\n\u201cNone know where they came from, but several seasons ago, a strange tribe entered our lands; much like us, but different. At first they were merely observers, but soon enough; they attacked. They burnt the land using their branches of fire, attacked our kind, leaving cinders and ash in their wake.\u201d \n\nThen my brain clicked. The emblem on the tree from earlier\u2026 \n\n\u201cIn the forest, I saw a carving, one that looked like a flame, was that their work\u201d? \n\nThe Chief unexpectedly recoiled. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re here\u201d He said in a concerned tone of voice. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer safe for you here, we need to return you to your realm.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut why\u201d? I asked. \n\n\u201cThe scorched have returned. If they find you, they will surely kill you\u2026or perhaps worse.\u201d\n\nHis description of these other beings sounded serious, but there was still a problem.  \n\n\u201cI came here through the other side of the valley, who knows how long it\u2019ll take us to get there.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe have our ways my boy, worry not.\u201d\n\nUltimately, I complied. But not without facing my uncle one last time. \n\nI looked at his skull, and paid my final respects. In a way I made peace with him. \n\nAlmost as soon as I came the chief and his grandchildren safely guided me back down to the foot of the mountain. When we did, I still had no idea how I was going to cover all that ground in such a short amount of time. \n\nThe chief looked over to his progenies and nodded. This signaled them both to let out a loud cackle, that echoed throughout the forest. For a minute, there was nothing. But soon enough running our way were three large bipeds. A trio of horse-sized dinosaurs that were much like ostriches in appearance, only with a long tail, stopped, right in front of us, before reaching down to nuzzle the two young ornithoids. \n\n\u201cThey will take you to the other side of the valley. None are their equal in speed.\u201d \n\nIt didn\u2019t take me long to notice that there were only three of them. \n\n\u201cAre you, not coming with us\u201d? I asked the chief. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I must stay here.\u201d He said. \n\n\u201cMy responsibility is to our village, and to keep our kind safe.\u201d \n\n\u201cI understand, but what\u2019s gonna happen? Will you be safe\u201d? \n\n\u201cPlacid as we are, self defense is nothing strange to us. We shall lay down our lives to defend our lands, and our kind.\u201d \n\nThe ostrich creatures knelt down, which promoted the chief\u2019s grandkids onto their backs. It was time to go. \n\nI carefully climbed onto the back of the third animal, positioning myself as one would with a horse. As it stood up, I could feel myself rushed into the air. Thing\u2019s back was quite sturdy. \n\nI looked down at the chief one last time. \n\n\u201cThank you, for everything.\u201d \n\n\u201cMay the ancestors guide you to safety.\u201d He said in response. \n\nMy fellow mountees let out another call, sending our steeds into a sprint. I could feel the air rushing past my head. Trees, ferns, and rocks all zipped past me. \n\nIt only took about 25 minutes to reach the forest\u2019s edge. Before I knew it I was back on the open plains. \n\nWhile we rode, I couldn\u2019t shake the thought of the aforementioned Scorched, the ones who killed my uncle. The way they were described by the chief painted them as dangerous entities, ones that weaponized fire. But just who, or what were they exactly? \n\nIn time we reached the center of the valley; halfway there, but time was running out. I noticed the sun, making its way down to the horizon. This put me on the timer, as the portal would soon close, trapping me here for a whole week. \n\nSuddenly however, an object came flying out in front of us. What looked like a flaming spear struck the ground; lighting it on fire. The impact of which frightened our steeds and sent them running adjacent. Another one landed in front of us, setting the ground ablaze, once more causing them to change direction. \n\nWe were now at top speed toward the other end of the valley. It wasn\u2019t long before more flaming spears were chucked at us from behind, just barely, but fortunately missing. \n\nOff to the side, I could make out movement in the grass. Whoever was chasing us, was also lighting quick. \n\nA dark figure then erupted from cover into the air. I only saw them for a brief moment, but got a good enough look to make out their appearance. \n\nThey looked like giant crows or ravens, only with a longer tail, hook-shaped talons on each foot, and a head that looked like some unholy cross between a lizard and a vulture. Their bodies were adorned with a variety of jewelry and tribal piercings. \n\nNearly there, just a little bit further. My mind focused only on the destination. \n\nAnother one lept out of the grass and chucked a spear from its mouth right in front of us. The impact of which spooked our mount, causing me to fall off. \n\nFrightened, my only mode of transportation ran off. \n\nA growing flame started rising in front of me.  I immediately jumped to my feet, but out from behind me, two of them emerged. They slowly crept toward me, hissing and clicking with their talons. Their bright yellow eyes making contact with mine. My heartbeat skyrocketed; something they could clearly pick up on. They \u2018enjoyed\u2019 my fear. \n\nBefore they could advance further on me, Something small and reddish in color hit one of them; exploding into a cloud of red dust. My attackers began to shriek and choke in agonizing pain. One of the chief\u2019s grandkids rode past, throwing another. The timing of which allowed me to escape. \n\nThe other young ornithoid rode up toward me, the ostrich creature kneeling down. I climbed on as fast as I could, and we took off. \n\nIt couldn\u2019t run as fast as before, now that it was carrying two passengers, but it was just enough to cover large tracks of ground. As I looked behind us I could see the prairie burning, the flames continuing to spread. I could only hope the chief\u2019s other progeny was ok. \n\nFollowing that ordeal, it didn\u2019t take long for us to arrive at our destination. We dismounted; our speedy ally proceeding to run off back into the grasslands. \n\nMy feathered companion bobbed their head at me, gesturing that I follow. However, this wasn\u2019t exactly the way I came down, instead it was a small ravine. A shortcut maybe? Nonetheless I followed. \n\nI looked up once more, and the sun was nearly about to set. I knew I needed to get my ass moving. \n\nMy guide led me through the ravine, safely navigating the bends and divots. \n\nFinally, there it was, exactly as I had left it. \n\nI turned to face my avian usher. I knew they didn\u2019t exactly know English, so I just decided  to nod to them, to which they did the same in response.\n\nI slowly walked over to the portal, relieved to finally go home - or so I thought. \n\nA shadowy figure kicked me, and I plummeted to the ground. It was another one of them; the Scorched. The things that killed my uncle. \n\nThis one was missing an eye, in fact half their face looked like it was singed off. Its snout possessed what looked like some sort of marking, reminiscent of a tribal tattoo. With an ominous stare it readied itself to pounce. \n\nIts talons lifted off the Earth, but was stopped midair by another figure ramming into it - the chief\u2019s progeny. \n\nThey wrestled my assailant; and as they did, they gave me one last look, and shrieked. I needed no translation, they were telling me to go; NOW. \n\nThe sun had set, and the portal was beginning to flicker. It was now or never. I barreled right through the portal. \n\nIn the blink of an eye it contracted. \n\nI was back in the desert, in my universe. The top of the bluff was lit, by the rising sun. \n\nIt\u2019s been roughly 8 months since all of this went down. Not a day has gone by where I haven\u2019t thought about my excursion. More importantly; the ornithoids. What was going to happen to them? The two who guided me through all those perils were the one\u2019s I worried about most. If not for them, I wouldn\u2019t have made it back, or still be alive for that matter. Who knows what happened to them though? It pains me to think about what horrible things the scorched would do to them. \n\nBy now however, the portals won\u2019t open again for another 20 years. Meaning all I can hope to do; is pray, that the ornithoids would be ok. But What if I didn\u2019t? What if there was a way to reopen the portals manually without having to wait another two decades? Ideas which crossed my mind not too long ago\n\nMy uncle spent years studying these gateways to other realities; what if there was hypothetically a way to open one? \n\nSooner or later, I\u2019ll come back for his research; try to better understand how it all works. I have since vowed to figure it out, so that I may return. ",

        "title": "I Discovered a Parallel Reality where Dinosaurs Never went Extinct.. Part 2",
        "selftext": "Out of the plains and into the woods. I was now traveling through a dense mosaic of conifers. The trees towering above me, baring an uncanny resemblance to the sequoias in California. \n\nNow I just needed to figure out where my uncle was, that is, if he had even settled here. I didn\u2019t stray too far from the stream, if there was any sign of somebody living here, i\u2019d imagine they\u2019d be close to water. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that everything in this version of Earth felt, bigger. The plants, the animals, simply the overall scale of this reality, it was enormous. \n\nThe hulking trees towered above me like buildings. Emanating from the canopy were the sounds of various birds, many of which sounded like nothing i\u2019d ever heard before. The forest floor was blanketed in groves of ferns, primeval in appearance. \n\nWhile continuing my way upstream, I regularly kept a sharp eye out for anything manmade. Some of the trees had massive; gaping holes in them, not dissimilar to the redwood forests of the pacific coast in our own timeline. I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d make an ideal place to camp out, although probably not for twenty years. While thinking about it, I came to a complete stop. \n\nNow I don\u2019t know what it was at the time, but something didn\u2019t sit right. I could feel a presence, not of an animal, no. This felt very different. \n\nSomething, or someone, was watching me. \n\nYet no matter where I looked, there was nothing. It\u2019s as if the trees themselves had eyes. \n\nPerhaps I was just on edge. I brushed it off, albeit reluctantly, and continued about my business. \n\nI followed the stream for what seemed like hours, but to no avail, did I find any sign of human presence. That, unexpectedly, would soon change. \n\nRight away, I caught a glimpse of something odd on the bark of a tree. The discovery of which piqued my curiosity. \n\nI went in for a closer look, and when I did, my eyes widened. Carved into the trunk of this conifer was some sort of image. The image looked like some sort of crest or sigil, circular with three points emerging on top. My best guess was that it was a flame. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t a doubt in my mind, this had to have been carved by my uncle. He must\u2019ve left this for me to find him. \n\nBelieving I was getting closer, I rushed back to the path down the stream without haste, I knew he had to be close by. Up ahead I could see a clearing, could this have been it? \n\nI emerged from the trees to find a pond ending at a small waterfall; the remainder of the stream now leading into the mountains. Unfortunately, there was no sign of any settlement. \n\nI was so certain though. He has to be in the vicinity, who else could\u2019ve carved that emblem? \n\n Exhausted, I decided to stop once more and head down to the water\u2019s edge for another drink. I crouched over and scooped up handfuls of water, guzzling it. I wasn\u2019t alone however. \n\nOut from the brush about 5 animals, one adult and 4 infants, appeared and treaded on down to the edge of the pond on the other side. They were similar to a pig in stature, but possessed a beak similar to a parrot\u2019s. \n\nInstinctively, I pulled out the notebook and cassette player, #4 referring me to the creature. \n\n*Part of the ceratopsid family; the horned dinosaurs, Choerumimus scrofa, the Hogbird, is a small forest-dwelling herbivore. It scours the forest floor, gorging on woody plants, bark, and roots. A shy animal, it is named for its similarities in behavior to wild pigs.* \n\nSeemingly a mother and offspring, they proceeded to the water for a drink. Not even seeming to acknowledge my existence. \n\nAside from the hogbirds and myself, it didn\u2019t seem like there was much activity at the pond. \n\nIn fact; things felt a little too quiet. \n\nThe sounds of the birds that filled the forest earlier had now ceased. It all felt suspicious. \n\nUnanticipatedly, the tree adjacent to the hogbird family, it\u2026moved. No, that was no tree. With a lightning fast reaction a massive bill shot down and grabbed one of the younger animals. The screaming infant struggled, calling out in fear, as a massive giraffe-like animal, with the head of a stork shook it violently. The other hogbirds fled, jetting off into the woods. The giant creature lifted its head back, and swallowed its catch whole. I swore I could see it go down the gullet. \n\nThis..thing, it was terrifying. Legs like stilts, a long, slender neck, and dark, reddish eyes that gave off a look of insatiable hunger. \n\nThen I realized. - I\u2019ve seen this animal before. It was the one from the petroglyphs engraved into the rock bluff. Could one of them some time ago have crossed over into our universe? \n\nIt then strided off into the woods. Lucky for me, it seemed it\u2019d had its fill. \n\nI picked up the notebook, and next to #7, was a sketch that vaguely resembled the petroglyphs. I skipped ahead on the cassette player to listen. \n\n*Messoropteryx daemoniensis; the Wood Reaper is a gargantuan pterosaur the size of a giraffe; and the apex predator of the conifer forests. They descend from the Ahzdarchids of the Late Cretaceous, a group that includes the famous \u2018Quetzalcoatlus\u2019, but have given up flight all together to become ground-based hunters. Utilizing ambush, their dark brown coloration allows them to blend into the forest, remaining motionless for unsuspecting prey to walk by, and then striking it with their massive bill. Prey is often swallowed whole, much like a stork or heron.* \n\nThe fact these things stand motionless, pretending to be trees made me all the more terrified. To think one of them actually wandered through that portal into our reality. I could only imagine what the people who encountered this thing felt. \n\nNot wanting to stick around with that stork-monster about, I decided to leave. \n\nI still had no lead on the location of my uncle. At this point it was starting to feel hopeless. But given the carving on the tree though, he had to be somewhere in the forest. Was he even still alive? \n\nThen another possibility came to me - higher ground. Perhaps he decided to set up camp on one of the mountain slopes, away from the dangers down below. Come to think of it, the waterfall had been flowing from higher elevation. Anybody living up there would likely have easy access to drinking water. \n\nI changed course and headed for the foothills of the mountain. \n\nI would first need to rejuvenate before I did, so I decided to stop and rest yet again. Up ahead, what looked like a barren tree seemed ideal. Without hesitation, I walked over and rested my arm on the trunk; a decision I would come to regret.. \n\nThe tree, within seconds of physical contact, moved. Of course it wasn\u2019t a tree, how was I that stupid? \n\nI looked up to see the ravenous glare of a wood reaper. The beast let out a deep bellow like some giant demonic goose, and thrusted its head downward. I barely moved out of the way, as it missed me by several inches. \n\nFast as I could I made a break for it, plowing through the endless patches of ferns. As I ran I could hear the reaper giving chase. It\u2019s freakishly long legs drumming the ground behind me. The damn thing was literally galloping. \n\nWith rapid thinking I made some sharp turns, which gave me a little more distance. I kept running, focusing on getting away with my life. To my misfortune, I hit a dead end - a flat wall of rock too vertical to climb. \n\nAs I turn to face my pursuer, I could see it, creeping around the corner of a tree, gradually closing in on me. Before I knew it this thing was no more than 3 meters away. \n\nThe reaper raised its head to strike, but out of nowhere, an object collided with its head; exploding on impact. A swarm of wasps was now marauding the creature, stinging it in vulnerable areas. The reaper let out a painful bellow, running off into the forest in agonizing pain.\n\nFor a moment; things went silent. I just witnessed a wasp nest get chucked at a giant murder-bird. It had to have been thrown\u2026by somebody. \n\nI looked up in all directions - no sign of anybody around, but as I did, something jumped down from behind me. \n\nWhen I turned around, I was greeted to a small creature, one that resembled a giant owl - but with arms, and a tail. It was roughly chest-high. \n\nThe most insane deatail; several pieces of jewelry hung around its neck. There was no mistake, whatever this thing was, it was sapient. \n\nThe hairy, or moreso feathered creature strutted over to me, not out of malice, but curiosity. It turned its head rapidly several times in a manor just like a bird, analyzing me up close. \n\nUnexpectedly, another one darted out from behind me, this one instead possessing a harness of some sort, that held a pouch against its chest. It too came up to study me. \n\nThe two of them circled me, eager to know what this strange skin-creature before them was. \n\nAfterwards, they congregated in front of me, making a series of chirps, hisses, and grunts to one another, no doubt their language. For about 5 minutes they \u2018spoke\u2019 to each other. Until eventually they looked at me, gesturing with their heads. One didn\u2019t have to be a linguist to understand that they wanted me to follow them. \n\nNeither of them acted truly aggressive toward me. Could my uncle have been living with these creatures? I felt I might stand a better chance of finding him if I came with, thus, I fell in line behind my two escorts. \n\nThe two \u2018birdmen\u2019 led me around the foothills of the mountain, circling the steep, purportedly unclimbable walls of rock. The more I looked at them, the more intrigued I became - could dinosaurs really have evolved society in this universe? Or even civilization? \n\nNaturally, the notebook must\u2019ve contained the answer to such a question. \n\nI opened it on the go, and there at #8 was a sketch reminiscent of my guides. I reached for the cassette player and started the next recording. \n\n*In a world without humans, non-avian dinosaurs would take up the mantle as a sapient species. This would lead to the development of the \u2018Ornithoids\u2019. Descending from a lineage of dinosaurs known as \u2018Thescelosaurids\u2019, a group of small, fast moving herbivores known in the fossil record for their burrowing habits, they have now entered a Stone Age, utilizing both stone and wooden tools for their everyday affairs. Their anatomy has drastically changed, once possessing a roadrunner-like appearance, they now have a build very similar to a burrowing owl; standing in a semi-upright gait, with arms possessing dexterous wrists. Living high up on mountain slopes, they venture down into the forest below only to forage for fruits, nuts and insects. Benign entities; their customs forbid acts of violence, baring life-threatening situations. I myself was able to befriend a tribe established along the slopes of what in our world is the Guadalupe Mountain Range, over time earning their trust. For a time, I lived amongst them, learning their ways, understanding how they perceived the world around them. Both of our realities occur at the same time, suggesting that the Ornithoids were able to avoid many of the mistakes humanity had made. The environment around them still flourished, a stark contrast to what\u2019s happening in our own timeline.* \n\nNot only was there an advanced society of dinosaurs in this version of our own world, but, they were peaceful, reasonable beings. On top of it all, I finally knew where my uncle had been these past two decades. \n\nI looked up to notice that the two Ornithoids escorting me stopped in their tracks. We were at a steep slope of jagged rocks. Both of them looking up towards the peak. The first one extended its legs and lifted off the ground, leaping onto the rocks; almost like a bird taking off. I watched them grip the rocks tightly scaling the near-vertical surface like it was nothing. \n\nMy other companion looked at me, gesturing me to continue following them. He led me towards a walkable, but treacherous ledge. Each step I took was carefully calculated, I mean, imagine coming all this way just to fall to your doom.. \n\nIt took a good 45 minutes, but upon arrival, we stood at the foot of a wall of vegetation, hanging down its face was a collection of vine-like plants. My feathered escort ran toward the wall, disappearing into the green. It was apparently a hidden passage of sorts. Without a second thought I went after them, taking me into what looked like a cave, but there was a light around the corner. I scaled the semi-steep path, and when I got to the end, there it was. \n\nA whole village of them nestled on the side of the mountain, overlooking the entire valley. Dozens of ornithoids were living here; their homes looked like hordes of branches and sticks weaved together, much like a birds\u2019 nest. \n\nMy presence was soon made evident, as many of them now fixated their attention on me. A reaction that was somewhat warranted, for as far as I knew, they\u2019ve only ever seen one other human, who was almost certainly here. Realizing that fact, I was anxious to finally see him. \n\nThe two individuals that led me here appeared before me, and again gestured to me to follow them. The three of us came upon the largest of the \u2018nest houses\u2019 at the center of the village, from the \u2018doorway\u2019 hung all sorts of woven ornaments. \n\nOnce inside, there, sat atop what looked like a large nest, was an ornithoid with much darker gray plumage, their arms folded against their chest like wings. Atop their head was a crown of ornamental vegetation sewn together, and around their neck hung all sorts of vivid jewelry. Obviously, this individual was the village leader or chief. \n\nThe two that led me here approached the old-timer, squawking and chirping up a storm. With a guttural hiss, they were silenced by their elder, who then gestured to them, signaling the pair to leave. \n\nAfter they exited the hut, the old, birdlike figure rose from their nest, and slowly approached, until they were right in front of me. \n\nWhat happened next, I never saw coming.. \n\n\u201cIt would seem you\u2019ve found yourself in quite the predicament, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI was completely speechless. In a surprising twist of events the village chief spoke to me - in perfect English. His voice very similar to a raven or parrot, but much deeper and more reserved. \n\n\u201cH-how, do you know my language, and more importantly how can you speak it?\u201d I asked. \n\nThe chief looked at me, knowing i\u2019d be surprised. \n\n\u201cAstonishing as it may seem, you are not the first otherworldly mammalian we\u2019ve encountered. Our kind has a unique ability to \u2018imitate\u2019 the sounds we hear.\u201d \n\nI was confident I knew who he was referring to. \n\n\u201cI apologize if my grandchildren caused you any trouble on the way here.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot at all\u201d I replied. \n\n\u201cIn fact, they saved my life.\u201d\n\nWanting to know more about this \u2018other human\u2019, I asked. \n\n\u201cYou mentioned somebody else like me. Who were they\u201d? \n\nTo which he replied:\n\n\u201cMany seasons ago another one of your kind came to our lands. While cautious at first, we realized they posed no threat. In accordance to our ways, we take the time to understand that which is unknown to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cFear, is the path to ignorance.\u201d He stated. \n\n\u201cWe took them in, taught them our ways, learned everything we could from them.\u201d \n\nThe chief then looked me directly in the eye. \n\n\u201cWhat is your name stranger\u201d? \n\n\u201cMy name is Henry.\u201d I told him. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come here looking for Dr. Carl Wilkinson.\u201d \n\nThe chief looked at me in shock. There was a look of sorrow in his eyes. \n\n\u201cI had long anticipated your arrival, Henry. I had known for a time that this day would come.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d? I asked. \n\nHis head hung, looking as if a tragedy had just occurred. \n\n\u201cCome my boy, there\u2019s something I must show you..\u201d \n\nThe Chief led me outside, we walked through the village until we reached a cavern, into which we entered. \n\nOnce inside, there was a whole row of mounds, the corridor illuminated by a set of torches. Each had a wooden staff protruding from their center. Mounted at the top of the poles were the skulls of assorted ornithoids. Clearly this was a crypt. \n\n\u201cThese are the halls of our deceased.\u201d Explained the chief. \n\n\u201cOnce we pass on, we are laid to rest here.\u201d \n\nThe skulls, inferred to be from the individuals buried in each plot, were the most interesting part, no doubt a part of their culture. \n\n\u201cWith respect, may I ask why it is that you display the skulls of your dead in this manner\u201d? \n\n\u201cThat is how we honor their memory. And so that their spirits can return to this realm to commune with their kin.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe dead..talk to you\u201d? \n\n\u201cNot in the way you may think.\u201d He explained. \n\n\u201cTo commune with the fallen, one must be attuned to their surroundings, and learn to listen to the land.\u201d \n\nI was never a religious guy, but I was amazed at how complex their culture was. 66 million years of evolution, and dinosaurs have not only continued to thrive, but have evolved advanced ways of life, much like humanity did, only without any of the horrific events that occurred in our own timeline. At least as far as I knew.. \n\nWe walked to the far end of the crypt. Atop the staff - was a human skull. \n\n\u201cCarl was an intelligent and benevolent soul. And he was a good friend.\u201d \n\nThe chief turned to face me. \n\n\u201cI am..terribly sorry.\u201d \n\nI had no words. After all this time searching, the man I came for\u2026was gone.\n\nI dropped to my knees. A feeling of emptiness engulfed me. I had no idea why. I hardly knew Carl, we practically never saw each other, so why? Why did I feel this way. \n\nThe chief put his scaly hand on my shoulder. \n\n\u201cIn the time he lived here, Carl had been planning for seasons, waiting for your arrival, to share this place with you. Share what he learned with one of his own. Once accomplished, he was to accompany you back to your realm.\u201d \n\nGiven what I\u2019d heard from his recordings, all he wanted, was for somebody to believe him this whole time. I at first merely dismissed him as a quiet, bizarre man who never made time for family. But all these years, he wanted to come home. \n\nI got up, and looked at my uncle\u2019s mounted skull, wishing I could talk to him. Then I turned to face the chief to ask another question. \n\n\u201cHow did he die\u201d? \n\nThe elderly birdman was quiet at first, but then spoke. \n\n\u201cHe was felled\u2026at the hands of the scorched.\u201d \n\nThe scorched? Who did he mean exactly? \n\nHe continued: \n\n\u201cNone know where they came from, but several seasons ago, a strange tribe entered our lands; much like us, but different. At first they were merely observers, but soon enough; they attacked. They burnt the land using their branches of fire, attacked our kind, leaving cinders and ash in their wake.\u201d \n\nThen my brain clicked. The emblem on the tree from earlier\u2026 \n\n\u201cIn the forest, I saw a carving, one that looked like a flame, was that their work\u201d? \n\nThe Chief unexpectedly recoiled. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re here\u201d He said in a concerned tone of voice. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer safe for you here, we need to return you to your realm.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut why\u201d? I asked. \n\n\u201cThe scorched have returned. If they find you, they will surely kill you\u2026or perhaps worse.\u201d\n\nHis description of these other beings sounded serious, but there was still a problem.  \n\n\u201cI came here through the other side of the valley, who knows how long it\u2019ll take us to get there.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe have our ways my boy, worry not.\u201d\n\nUltimately, I complied. But not without facing my uncle one last time. \n\nI looked at his skull, and paid my final respects. In a way I made peace with him. \n\nAlmost as soon as I came the chief and his grandchildren safely guided me back down to the foot of the mountain. When we did, I still had no idea how I was going to cover all that ground in such a short amount of time. \n\nThe chief looked over to his progenies and nodded. This signaled them both to let out a loud cackle, that echoed throughout the forest. For a minute, there was nothing. But soon enough running our way were three large bipeds. A trio of horse-sized dinosaurs that were much like ostriches in appearance, only with a long tail, stopped, right in front of us, before reaching down to nuzzle the two young ornithoids. \n\n\u201cThey will take you to the other side of the valley. None are their equal in speed.\u201d \n\nIt didn\u2019t take me long to notice that there were only three of them. \n\n\u201cAre you, not coming with us\u201d? I asked the chief. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I must stay here.\u201d He said. \n\n\u201cMy responsibility is to our village, and to keep our kind safe.\u201d \n\n\u201cI understand, but what\u2019s gonna happen? Will you be safe\u201d? \n\n\u201cPlacid as we are, self defense is nothing strange to us. We shall lay down our lives to defend our lands, and our kind.\u201d \n\nThe ostrich creatures knelt down, which promoted the chief\u2019s grandkids onto their backs. It was time to go. \n\nI carefully climbed onto the back of the third animal, positioning myself as one would with a horse. As it stood up, I could feel myself rushed into the air. Thing\u2019s back was quite sturdy. \n\nI looked down at the chief one last time. \n\n\u201cThank you, for everything.\u201d \n\n\u201cMay the ancestors guide you to safety.\u201d He said in response. \n\nMy fellow mountees let out another call, sending our steeds into a sprint. I could feel the air rushing past my head. Trees, ferns, and rocks all zipped past me. \n\nIt only took about 25 minutes to reach the forest\u2019s edge. Before I knew it I was back on the open plains. \n\nWhile we rode, I couldn\u2019t shake the thought of the aforementioned Scorched, the ones who killed my uncle. The way they were described by the chief painted them as dangerous entities, ones that weaponized fire. But just who, or what were they exactly? \n\nIn time we reached the center of the valley; halfway there, but time was running out. I noticed the sun, making its way down to the horizon. This put me on the timer, as the portal would soon close, trapping me here for a whole week. \n\nSuddenly however, an object came flying out in front of us. What looked like a flaming spear struck the ground; lighting it on fire. The impact of which frightened our steeds and sent them running adjacent. Another one landed in front of us, setting the ground ablaze, once more causing them to change direction. \n\nWe were now at top speed toward the other end of the valley. It wasn\u2019t long before more flaming spears were chucked at us from behind, just barely, but fortunately missing. \n\nOff to the side, I could make out movement in the grass. Whoever was chasing us, was also lighting quick. \n\nA dark figure then erupted from cover into the air. I only saw them for a brief moment, but got a good enough look to make out their appearance. \n\nThey looked like giant crows or ravens, only with a longer tail, hook-shaped talons on each foot, and a head that looked like some unholy cross between a lizard and a vulture. Their bodies were adorned with a variety of jewelry and tribal piercings. \n\nNearly there, just a little bit further. My mind focused only on the destination. \n\nAnother one lept out of the grass and chucked a spear from its mouth right in front of us. The impact of which spooked our mount, causing me to fall off. \n\nFrightened, my only mode of transportation ran off. \n\nA growing flame started rising in front of me.  I immediately jumped to my feet, but out from behind me, two of them emerged. They slowly crept toward me, hissing and clicking with their talons. Their bright yellow eyes making contact with mine. My heartbeat skyrocketed; something they could clearly pick up on. They \u2018enjoyed\u2019 my fear. \n\nBefore they could advance further on me, Something small and reddish in color hit one of them; exploding into a cloud of red dust. My attackers began to shriek and choke in agonizing pain. One of the chief\u2019s grandkids rode past, throwing another. The timing of which allowed me to escape. \n\nThe other young ornithoid rode up toward me, the ostrich creature kneeling down. I climbed on as fast as I could, and we took off. \n\nIt couldn\u2019t run as fast as before, now that it was carrying two passengers, but it was just enough to cover large tracks of ground. As I looked behind us I could see the prairie burning, the flames continuing to spread. I could only hope the chief\u2019s other progeny was ok. \n\nFollowing that ordeal, it didn\u2019t take long for us to arrive at our destination. We dismounted; our speedy ally proceeding to run off back into the grasslands. \n\nMy feathered companion bobbed their head at me, gesturing that I follow. However, this wasn\u2019t exactly the way I came down, instead it was a small ravine. A shortcut maybe? Nonetheless I followed. \n\nI looked up once more, and the sun was nearly about to set. I knew I needed to get my ass moving. \n\nMy guide led me through the ravine, safely navigating the bends and divots. \n\nFinally, there it was, exactly as I had left it. \n\nI turned to face my avian usher. I knew they didn\u2019t exactly know English, so I just decided  to nod to them, to which they did the same in response.\n\nI slowly walked over to the portal, relieved to finally go home - or so I thought. \n\nA shadowy figure kicked me, and I plummeted to the ground. It was another one of them; the Scorched. The things that killed my uncle. \n\nThis one was missing an eye, in fact half their face looked like it was singed off. Its snout possessed what looked like some sort of marking, reminiscent of a tribal tattoo. With an ominous stare it readied itself to pounce. \n\nIts talons lifted off the Earth, but was stopped midair by another figure ramming into it - the chief\u2019s progeny. \n\nThey wrestled my assailant; and as they did, they gave me one last look, and shrieked. I needed no translation, they were telling me to go; NOW. \n\nThe sun had set, and the portal was beginning to flicker. It was now or never. I barreled right through the portal. \n\nIn the blink of an eye it contracted. \n\nI was back in the desert, in my universe. The top of the bluff was lit, by the rising sun. \n\nIt\u2019s been roughly 8 months since all of this went down. Not a day has gone by where I haven\u2019t thought about my excursion. More importantly; the ornithoids. What was going to happen to them? The two who guided me through all those perils were the one\u2019s I worried about most. If not for them, I wouldn\u2019t have made it back, or still be alive for that matter. Who knows what happened to them though? It pains me to think about what horrible things the scorched would do to them. \n\nBy now however, the portals won\u2019t open again for another 20 years. Meaning all I can hope to do; is pray, that the ornithoids would be ok. But What if I didn\u2019t? What if there was a way to reopen the portals manually without having to wait another two decades? Ideas which crossed my mind not too long ago\n\nMy uncle spent years studying these gateways to other realities; what if there was hypothetically a way to open one? \n\nSooner or later, I\u2019ll come back for his research; try to better understand how it all works. I have since vowed to figure it out, so that I may return. ",

        "title": "I Discovered a Parallel Reality where Dinosaurs Never went Extinct.. Part 2",
        "selftext": "Out of the plains and into the woods. I was now traveling through a dense mosaic of conifers. The trees towering above me, baring an uncanny resemblance to the sequoias in California. \n\nNow I just needed to figure out where my uncle was, that is, if he had even settled here. I didn\u2019t stray too far from the stream, if there was any sign of somebody living here, i\u2019d imagine they\u2019d be close to water. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that everything in this version of Earth felt, bigger. The plants, the animals, simply the overall scale of this reality, it was enormous. \n\nThe hulking trees towered above me like buildings. Emanating from the canopy were the sounds of various birds, many of which sounded like nothing i\u2019d ever heard before. The forest floor was blanketed in groves of ferns, primeval in appearance. \n\nWhile continuing my way upstream, I regularly kept a sharp eye out for anything manmade. Some of the trees had massive; gaping holes in them, not dissimilar to the redwood forests of the pacific coast in our own timeline. I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d make an ideal place to camp out, although probably not for twenty years. While thinking about it, I came to a complete stop. \n\nNow I don\u2019t know what it was at the time, but something didn\u2019t sit right. I could feel a presence, not of an animal, no. This felt very different. \n\nSomething, or someone, was watching me. \n\nYet no matter where I looked, there was nothing. It\u2019s as if the trees themselves had eyes. \n\nPerhaps I was just on edge. I brushed it off, albeit reluctantly, and continued about my business. \n\nI followed the stream for what seemed like hours, but to no avail, did I find any sign of human presence. That, unexpectedly, would soon change. \n\nRight away, I caught a glimpse of something odd on the bark of a tree. The discovery of which piqued my curiosity. \n\nI went in for a closer look, and when I did, my eyes widened. Carved into the trunk of this conifer was some sort of image. The image looked like some sort of crest or sigil, circular with three points emerging on top. My best guess was that it was a flame. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t a doubt in my mind, this had to have been carved by my uncle. He must\u2019ve left this for me to find him. \n\nBelieving I was getting closer, I rushed back to the path down the stream without haste, I knew he had to be close by. Up ahead I could see a clearing, could this have been it? \n\nI emerged from the trees to find a pond ending at a small waterfall; the remainder of the stream now leading into the mountains. Unfortunately, there was no sign of any settlement. \n\nI was so certain though. He has to be in the vicinity, who else could\u2019ve carved that emblem? \n\n Exhausted, I decided to stop once more and head down to the water\u2019s edge for another drink. I crouched over and scooped up handfuls of water, guzzling it. I wasn\u2019t alone however. \n\nOut from the brush about 5 animals, one adult and 4 infants, appeared and treaded on down to the edge of the pond on the other side. They were similar to a pig in stature, but possessed a beak similar to a parrot\u2019s. \n\nInstinctively, I pulled out the notebook and cassette player, #4 referring me to the creature. \n\n*Part of the ceratopsid family; the horned dinosaurs, Choerumimus scrofa, the Hogbird, is a small forest-dwelling herbivore. It scours the forest floor, gorging on woody plants, bark, and roots. A shy animal, it is named for its similarities in behavior to wild pigs.* \n\nSeemingly a mother and offspring, they proceeded to the water for a drink. Not even seeming to acknowledge my existence. \n\nAside from the hogbirds and myself, it didn\u2019t seem like there was much activity at the pond. \n\nIn fact; things felt a little too quiet. \n\nThe sounds of the birds that filled the forest earlier had now ceased. It all felt suspicious. \n\nUnanticipatedly, the tree adjacent to the hogbird family, it\u2026moved. No, that was no tree. With a lightning fast reaction a massive bill shot down and grabbed one of the younger animals. The screaming infant struggled, calling out in fear, as a massive giraffe-like animal, with the head of a stork shook it violently. The other hogbirds fled, jetting off into the woods. The giant creature lifted its head back, and swallowed its catch whole. I swore I could see it go down the gullet. \n\nThis..thing, it was terrifying. Legs like stilts, a long, slender neck, and dark, reddish eyes that gave off a look of insatiable hunger. \n\nThen I realized. - I\u2019ve seen this animal before. It was the one from the petroglyphs engraved into the rock bluff. Could one of them some time ago have crossed over into our universe? \n\nIt then strided off into the woods. Lucky for me, it seemed it\u2019d had its fill. \n\nI picked up the notebook, and next to #7, was a sketch that vaguely resembled the petroglyphs. I skipped ahead on the cassette player to listen. \n\n*Messoropteryx daemoniensis; the Wood Reaper is a gargantuan pterosaur the size of a giraffe; and the apex predator of the conifer forests. They descend from the Ahzdarchids of the Late Cretaceous, a group that includes the famous \u2018Quetzalcoatlus\u2019, but have given up flight all together to become ground-based hunters. Utilizing ambush, their dark brown coloration allows them to blend into the forest, remaining motionless for unsuspecting prey to walk by, and then striking it with their massive bill. Prey is often swallowed whole, much like a stork or heron.* \n\nThe fact these things stand motionless, pretending to be trees made me all the more terrified. To think one of them actually wandered through that portal into our reality. I could only imagine what the people who encountered this thing felt. \n\nNot wanting to stick around with that stork-monster about, I decided to leave. \n\nI still had no lead on the location of my uncle. At this point it was starting to feel hopeless. But given the carving on the tree though, he had to be somewhere in the forest. Was he even still alive? \n\nThen another possibility came to me - higher ground. Perhaps he decided to set up camp on one of the mountain slopes, away from the dangers down below. Come to think of it, the waterfall had been flowing from higher elevation. Anybody living up there would likely have easy access to drinking water. \n\nI changed course and headed for the foothills of the mountain. \n\nI would first need to rejuvenate before I did, so I decided to stop and rest yet again. Up ahead, what looked like a barren tree seemed ideal. Without hesitation, I walked over and rested my arm on the trunk; a decision I would come to regret.. \n\nThe tree, within seconds of physical contact, moved. Of course it wasn\u2019t a tree, how was I that stupid? \n\nI looked up to see the ravenous glare of a wood reaper. The beast let out a deep bellow like some giant demonic goose, and thrusted its head downward. I barely moved out of the way, as it missed me by several inches. \n\nFast as I could I made a break for it, plowing through the endless patches of ferns. As I ran I could hear the reaper giving chase. It\u2019s freakishly long legs drumming the ground behind me. The damn thing was literally galloping. \n\nWith rapid thinking I made some sharp turns, which gave me a little more distance. I kept running, focusing on getting away with my life. To my misfortune, I hit a dead end - a flat wall of rock too vertical to climb. \n\nAs I turn to face my pursuer, I could see it, creeping around the corner of a tree, gradually closing in on me. Before I knew it this thing was no more than 3 meters away. \n\nThe reaper raised its head to strike, but out of nowhere, an object collided with its head; exploding on impact. A swarm of wasps was now marauding the creature, stinging it in vulnerable areas. The reaper let out a painful bellow, running off into the forest in agonizing pain.\n\nFor a moment; things went silent. I just witnessed a wasp nest get chucked at a giant murder-bird. It had to have been thrown\u2026by somebody. \n\nI looked up in all directions - no sign of anybody around, but as I did, something jumped down from behind me. \n\nWhen I turned around, I was greeted to a small creature, one that resembled a giant owl - but with arms, and a tail. It was roughly chest-high. \n\nThe most insane deatail; several pieces of jewelry hung around its neck. There was no mistake, whatever this thing was, it was sapient. \n\nThe hairy, or moreso feathered creature strutted over to me, not out of malice, but curiosity. It turned its head rapidly several times in a manor just like a bird, analyzing me up close. \n\nUnexpectedly, another one darted out from behind me, this one instead possessing a harness of some sort, that held a pouch against its chest. It too came up to study me. \n\nThe two of them circled me, eager to know what this strange skin-creature before them was. \n\nAfterwards, they congregated in front of me, making a series of chirps, hisses, and grunts to one another, no doubt their language. For about 5 minutes they \u2018spoke\u2019 to each other. Until eventually they looked at me, gesturing with their heads. One didn\u2019t have to be a linguist to understand that they wanted me to follow them. \n\nNeither of them acted truly aggressive toward me. Could my uncle have been living with these creatures? I felt I might stand a better chance of finding him if I came with, thus, I fell in line behind my two escorts. \n\nThe two \u2018birdmen\u2019 led me around the foothills of the mountain, circling the steep, purportedly unclimbable walls of rock. The more I looked at them, the more intrigued I became - could dinosaurs really have evolved society in this universe? Or even civilization? \n\nNaturally, the notebook must\u2019ve contained the answer to such a question. \n\nI opened it on the go, and there at #8 was a sketch reminiscent of my guides. I reached for the cassette player and started the next recording. \n\n*In a world without humans, non-avian dinosaurs would take up the mantle as a sapient species. This would lead to the development of the \u2018Ornithoids\u2019. Descending from a lineage of dinosaurs known as \u2018Thescelosaurids\u2019, a group of small, fast moving herbivores known in the fossil record for their burrowing habits, they have now entered a Stone Age, utilizing both stone and wooden tools for their everyday affairs. Their anatomy has drastically changed, once possessing a roadrunner-like appearance, they now have a build very similar to a burrowing owl; standing in a semi-upright gait, with arms possessing dexterous wrists. Living high up on mountain slopes, they venture down into the forest below only to forage for fruits, nuts and insects. Benign entities; their customs forbid acts of violence, baring life-threatening situations. I myself was able to befriend a tribe established along the slopes of what in our world is the Guadalupe Mountain Range, over time earning their trust. For a time, I lived amongst them, learning their ways, understanding how they perceived the world around them. Both of our realities occur at the same time, suggesting that the Ornithoids were able to avoid many of the mistakes humanity had made. The environment around them still flourished, a stark contrast to what\u2019s happening in our own timeline.* \n\nNot only was there an advanced society of dinosaurs in this version of our own world, but, they were peaceful, reasonable beings. On top of it all, I finally knew where my uncle had been these past two decades. \n\nI looked up to notice that the two Ornithoids escorting me stopped in their tracks. We were at a steep slope of jagged rocks. Both of them looking up towards the peak. The first one extended its legs and lifted off the ground, leaping onto the rocks; almost like a bird taking off. I watched them grip the rocks tightly scaling the near-vertical surface like it was nothing. \n\nMy other companion looked at me, gesturing me to continue following them. He led me towards a walkable, but treacherous ledge. Each step I took was carefully calculated, I mean, imagine coming all this way just to fall to your doom.. \n\nIt took a good 45 minutes, but upon arrival, we stood at the foot of a wall of vegetation, hanging down its face was a collection of vine-like plants. My feathered escort ran toward the wall, disappearing into the green. It was apparently a hidden passage of sorts. Without a second thought I went after them, taking me into what looked like a cave, but there was a light around the corner. I scaled the semi-steep path, and when I got to the end, there it was. \n\nA whole village of them nestled on the side of the mountain, overlooking the entire valley. Dozens of ornithoids were living here; their homes looked like hordes of branches and sticks weaved together, much like a birds\u2019 nest. \n\nMy presence was soon made evident, as many of them now fixated their attention on me. A reaction that was somewhat warranted, for as far as I knew, they\u2019ve only ever seen one other human, who was almost certainly here. Realizing that fact, I was anxious to finally see him. \n\nThe two individuals that led me here appeared before me, and again gestured to me to follow them. The three of us came upon the largest of the \u2018nest houses\u2019 at the center of the village, from the \u2018doorway\u2019 hung all sorts of woven ornaments. \n\nOnce inside, there, sat atop what looked like a large nest, was an ornithoid with much darker gray plumage, their arms folded against their chest like wings. Atop their head was a crown of ornamental vegetation sewn together, and around their neck hung all sorts of vivid jewelry. Obviously, this individual was the village leader or chief. \n\nThe two that led me here approached the old-timer, squawking and chirping up a storm. With a guttural hiss, they were silenced by their elder, who then gestured to them, signaling the pair to leave. \n\nAfter they exited the hut, the old, birdlike figure rose from their nest, and slowly approached, until they were right in front of me. \n\nWhat happened next, I never saw coming.. \n\n\u201cIt would seem you\u2019ve found yourself in quite the predicament, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI was completely speechless. In a surprising twist of events the village chief spoke to me - in perfect English. His voice very similar to a raven or parrot, but much deeper and more reserved. \n\n\u201cH-how, do you know my language, and more importantly how can you speak it?\u201d I asked. \n\nThe chief looked at me, knowing i\u2019d be surprised. \n\n\u201cAstonishing as it may seem, you are not the first otherworldly mammalian we\u2019ve encountered. Our kind has a unique ability to \u2018imitate\u2019 the sounds we hear.\u201d \n\nI was confident I knew who he was referring to. \n\n\u201cI apologize if my grandchildren caused you any trouble on the way here.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot at all\u201d I replied. \n\n\u201cIn fact, they saved my life.\u201d\n\nWanting to know more about this \u2018other human\u2019, I asked. \n\n\u201cYou mentioned somebody else like me. Who were they\u201d? \n\nTo which he replied:\n\n\u201cMany seasons ago another one of your kind came to our lands. While cautious at first, we realized they posed no threat. In accordance to our ways, we take the time to understand that which is unknown to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cFear, is the path to ignorance.\u201d He stated. \n\n\u201cWe took them in, taught them our ways, learned everything we could from them.\u201d \n\nThe chief then looked me directly in the eye. \n\n\u201cWhat is your name stranger\u201d? \n\n\u201cMy name is Henry.\u201d I told him. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come here looking for Dr. Carl Wilkinson.\u201d \n\nThe chief looked at me in shock. There was a look of sorrow in his eyes. \n\n\u201cI had long anticipated your arrival, Henry. I had known for a time that this day would come.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d? I asked. \n\nHis head hung, looking as if a tragedy had just occurred. \n\n\u201cCome my boy, there\u2019s something I must show you..\u201d \n\nThe Chief led me outside, we walked through the village until we reached a cavern, into which we entered. \n\nOnce inside, there was a whole row of mounds, the corridor illuminated by a set of torches. Each had a wooden staff protruding from their center. Mounted at the top of the poles were the skulls of assorted ornithoids. Clearly this was a crypt. \n\n\u201cThese are the halls of our deceased.\u201d Explained the chief. \n\n\u201cOnce we pass on, we are laid to rest here.\u201d \n\nThe skulls, inferred to be from the individuals buried in each plot, were the most interesting part, no doubt a part of their culture. \n\n\u201cWith respect, may I ask why it is that you display the skulls of your dead in this manner\u201d? \n\n\u201cThat is how we honor their memory. And so that their spirits can return to this realm to commune with their kin.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe dead..talk to you\u201d? \n\n\u201cNot in the way you may think.\u201d He explained. \n\n\u201cTo commune with the fallen, one must be attuned to their surroundings, and learn to listen to the land.\u201d \n\nI was never a religious guy, but I was amazed at how complex their culture was. 66 million years of evolution, and dinosaurs have not only continued to thrive, but have evolved advanced ways of life, much like humanity did, only without any of the horrific events that occurred in our own timeline. At least as far as I knew.. \n\nWe walked to the far end of the crypt. Atop the staff - was a human skull. \n\n\u201cCarl was an intelligent and benevolent soul. And he was a good friend.\u201d \n\nThe chief turned to face me. \n\n\u201cI am..terribly sorry.\u201d \n\nI had no words. After all this time searching, the man I came for\u2026was gone.\n\nI dropped to my knees. A feeling of emptiness engulfed me. I had no idea why. I hardly knew Carl, we practically never saw each other, so why? Why did I feel this way. \n\nThe chief put his scaly hand on my shoulder. \n\n\u201cIn the time he lived here, Carl had been planning for seasons, waiting for your arrival, to share this place with you. Share what he learned with one of his own. Once accomplished, he was to accompany you back to your realm.\u201d \n\nGiven what I\u2019d heard from his recordings, all he wanted, was for somebody to believe him this whole time. I at first merely dismissed him as a quiet, bizarre man who never made time for family. But all these years, he wanted to come home. \n\nI got up, and looked at my uncle\u2019s mounted skull, wishing I could talk to him. Then I turned to face the chief to ask another question. \n\n\u201cHow did he die\u201d? \n\nThe elderly birdman was quiet at first, but then spoke. \n\n\u201cHe was felled\u2026at the hands of the scorched.\u201d \n\nThe scorched? Who did he mean exactly? \n\nHe continued: \n\n\u201cNone know where they came from, but several seasons ago, a strange tribe entered our lands; much like us, but different. At first they were merely observers, but soon enough; they attacked. They burnt the land using their branches of fire, attacked our kind, leaving cinders and ash in their wake.\u201d \n\nThen my brain clicked. The emblem on the tree from earlier\u2026 \n\n\u201cIn the forest, I saw a carving, one that looked like a flame, was that their work\u201d? \n\nThe Chief unexpectedly recoiled. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re here\u201d He said in a concerned tone of voice. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer safe for you here, we need to return you to your realm.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut why\u201d? I asked. \n\n\u201cThe scorched have returned. If they find you, they will surely kill you\u2026or perhaps worse.\u201d\n\nHis description of these other beings sounded serious, but there was still a problem.  \n\n\u201cI came here through the other side of the valley, who knows how long it\u2019ll take us to get there.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe have our ways my boy, worry not.\u201d\n\nUltimately, I complied. But not without facing my uncle one last time. \n\nI looked at his skull, and paid my final respects. In a way I made peace with him. \n\nAlmost as soon as I came the chief and his grandchildren safely guided me back down to the foot of the mountain. When we did, I still had no idea how I was going to cover all that ground in such a short amount of time. \n\nThe chief looked over to his progenies and nodded. This signaled them both to let out a loud cackle, that echoed throughout the forest. For a minute, there was nothing. But soon enough running our way were three large bipeds. A trio of horse-sized dinosaurs that were much like ostriches in appearance, only with a long tail, stopped, right in front of us, before reaching down to nuzzle the two young ornithoids. \n\n\u201cThey will take you to the other side of the valley. None are their equal in speed.\u201d \n\nIt didn\u2019t take me long to notice that there were only three of them. \n\n\u201cAre you, not coming with us\u201d? I asked the chief. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I must stay here.\u201d He said. \n\n\u201cMy responsibility is to our village, and to keep our kind safe.\u201d \n\n\u201cI understand, but what\u2019s gonna happen? Will you be safe\u201d? \n\n\u201cPlacid as we are, self defense is nothing strange to us. We shall lay down our lives to defend our lands, and our kind.\u201d \n\nThe ostrich creatures knelt down, which promoted the chief\u2019s grandkids onto their backs. It was time to go. \n\nI carefully climbed onto the back of the third animal, positioning myself as one would with a horse. As it stood up, I could feel myself rushed into the air. Thing\u2019s back was quite sturdy. \n\nI looked down at the chief one last time. \n\n\u201cThank you, for everything.\u201d \n\n\u201cMay the ancestors guide you to safety.\u201d He said in response. \n\nMy fellow mountees let out another call, sending our steeds into a sprint. I could feel the air rushing past my head. Trees, ferns, and rocks all zipped past me. \n\nIt only took about 25 minutes to reach the forest\u2019s edge. Before I knew it I was back on the open plains. \n\nWhile we rode, I couldn\u2019t shake the thought of the aforementioned Scorched, the ones who killed my uncle. The way they were described by the chief painted them as dangerous entities, ones that weaponized fire. But just who, or what were they exactly? \n\nIn time we reached the center of the valley; halfway there, but time was running out. I noticed the sun, making its way down to the horizon. This put me on the timer, as the portal would soon close, trapping me here for a whole week. \n\nSuddenly however, an object came flying out in front of us. What looked like a flaming spear struck the ground; lighting it on fire. The impact of which frightened our steeds and sent them running adjacent. Another one landed in front of us, setting the ground ablaze, once more causing them to change direction. \n\nWe were now at top speed toward the other end of the valley. It wasn\u2019t long before more flaming spears were chucked at us from behind, just barely, but fortunately missing. \n\nOff to the side, I could make out movement in the grass. Whoever was chasing us, was also lighting quick. \n\nA dark figure then erupted from cover into the air. I only saw them for a brief moment, but got a good enough look to make out their appearance. \n\nThey looked like giant crows or ravens, only with a longer tail, hook-shaped talons on each foot, and a head that looked like some unholy cross between a lizard and a vulture. Their bodies were adorned with a variety of jewelry and tribal piercings. \n\nNearly there, just a little bit further. My mind focused only on the destination. \n\nAnother one lept out of the grass and chucked a spear from its mouth right in front of us. The impact of which spooked our mount, causing me to fall off. \n\nFrightened, my only mode of transportation ran off. \n\nA growing flame started rising in front of me.  I immediately jumped to my feet, but out from behind me, two of them emerged. They slowly crept toward me, hissing and clicking with their talons. Their bright yellow eyes making contact with mine. My heartbeat skyrocketed; something they could clearly pick up on. They \u2018enjoyed\u2019 my fear. \n\nBefore they could advance further on me, Something small and reddish in color hit one of them; exploding into a cloud of red dust. My attackers began to shriek and choke in agonizing pain. One of the chief\u2019s grandkids rode past, throwing another. The timing of which allowed me to escape. \n\nThe other young ornithoid rode up toward me, the ostrich creature kneeling down. I climbed on as fast as I could, and we took off. \n\nIt couldn\u2019t run as fast as before, now that it was carrying two passengers, but it was just enough to cover large tracks of ground. As I looked behind us I could see the prairie burning, the flames continuing to spread. I could only hope the chief\u2019s other progeny was ok. \n\nFollowing that ordeal, it didn\u2019t take long for us to arrive at our destination. We dismounted; our speedy ally proceeding to run off back into the grasslands. \n\nMy feathered companion bobbed their head at me, gesturing that I follow. However, this wasn\u2019t exactly the way I came down, instead it was a small ravine. A shortcut maybe? Nonetheless I followed. \n\nI looked up once more, and the sun was nearly about to set. I knew I needed to get my ass moving. \n\nMy guide led me through the ravine, safely navigating the bends and divots. \n\nFinally, there it was, exactly as I had left it. \n\nI turned to face my avian usher. I knew they didn\u2019t exactly know English, so I just decided  to nod to them, to which they did the same in response.\n\nI slowly walked over to the portal, relieved to finally go home - or so I thought. \n\nA shadowy figure kicked me, and I plummeted to the ground. It was another one of them; the Scorched. The things that killed my uncle. \n\nThis one was missing an eye, in fact half their face looked like it was singed off. Its snout possessed what looked like some sort of marking, reminiscent of a tribal tattoo. With an ominous stare it readied itself to pounce. \n\nIts talons lifted off the Earth, but was stopped midair by another figure ramming into it - the chief\u2019s progeny. \n\nThey wrestled my assailant; and as they did, they gave me one last look, and shrieked. I needed no translation, they were telling me to go; NOW. \n\nThe sun had set, and the portal was beginning to flicker. It was now or never. I barreled right through the portal. \n\nIn the blink of an eye it contracted. \n\nI was back in the desert, in my universe. The top of the bluff was lit, by the rising sun. \n\nIt\u2019s been roughly 8 months since all of this went down. Not a day has gone by where I haven\u2019t thought about my excursion. More importantly; the ornithoids. What was going to happen to them? The two who guided me through all those perils were the one\u2019s I worried about most. If not for them, I wouldn\u2019t have made it back, or still be alive for that matter. Who knows what happened to them though? It pains me to think about what horrible things the scorched would do to them. \n\nBy now however, the portals won\u2019t open again for another 20 years. Meaning all I can hope to do; is pray, that the ornithoids would be ok. But What if I didn\u2019t? What if there was a way to reopen the portals manually without having to wait another two decades? Ideas which crossed my mind not too long ago\n\nMy uncle spent years studying these gateways to other realities; what if there was hypothetically a way to open one? \n\nSooner or later, I\u2019ll come back for his research; try to better understand how it all works. I have since vowed to figure it out, so that I may return. ",

I adopted her at 6 months old after she was rescued from a local cat colony.\n\nShe showed zero signs of struggling to adapt to indoors and her litter box for the first year. 14 months after, however, she began periodically peeing on the bed. Weird? I thought it was just because litter box was due for a change.\n\nSince then, we have found ZERO solutions. There is no rhyme or reason to why she will only sometimes use her litter box. She will go weeks without an accident, then will pee 3 times in one day in random places throughout the house. Then sometimes, every other day on the bed while still using the litter box whenever. She pees on rugs, the bed, the couch, blankets, shoes, anything. One time, on my legs while I was asleep.\n\nI have tried EVERYTHING. There were no major routine changes when this all began or since then. During this year, I've changed types of litter and litter boxes. I've moved and added litter boxes. I use spray deterrents. I give her enrichment items and activities. I cover my bed with shower curtains (she'll pee on top of the curtain). \n\nI've tried taking her to the vet only to be told \"cats get stressed easily, and you may never know the cause.\"\n\nI am desperate. I am so paranoid that I hallucinate the smell of cat pee. I'm tired of coming home to more accidents, and my partner and I are beyond exhausted. She seems so happy and is a lively cat. I love her so much, but this is a miserable way to live with a pet. I've had cats my entire life, and this has never once happened to me.\n\nPlease help?

        "title": "I Discovered a Parallel Reality where Dinosaurs Never went Extinct.. Part 2",
        "selftext": "Out of the plains and into the woods. I was now traveling through a dense mosaic of conifers. The trees towering above me, baring an uncanny resemblance to the sequoias in California. \n\nNow I just needed to figure out where my uncle was, that is, if he had even settled here. I didn\u2019t stray too far from the stream, if there was any sign of somebody living here, i\u2019d imagine they\u2019d be close to water. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that everything in this version of Earth felt, bigger. The plants, the animals, simply the overall scale of this reality, it was enormous. \n\nThe hulking trees towered above me like buildings. Emanating from the canopy were the sounds of various birds, many of which sounded like nothing i\u2019d ever heard before. The forest floor was blanketed in groves of ferns, primeval in appearance. \n\nWhile continuing my way upstream, I regularly kept a sharp eye out for anything manmade. Some of the trees had massive; gaping holes in them, not dissimilar to the redwood forests of the pacific coast in our own timeline. I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d make an ideal place to camp out, although probably not for twenty years. While thinking about it, I came to a complete stop. \n\nNow I don\u2019t know what it was at the time, but something didn\u2019t sit right. I could feel a presence, not of an animal, no. This felt very different. \n\nSomething, or someone, was watching me. \n\nYet no matter where I looked, there was nothing. It\u2019s as if the trees themselves had eyes. \n\nPerhaps I was just on edge. I brushed it off, albeit reluctantly, and continued about my business. \n\nI followed the stream for what seemed like hours, but to no avail, did I find any sign of human presence. That, unexpectedly, would soon change. \n\nRight away, I caught a glimpse of something odd on the bark of a tree. The discovery of which piqued my curiosity. \n\nI went in for a closer look, and when I did, my eyes widened. Carved into the trunk of this conifer was some sort of image. The image looked like some sort of crest or sigil, circular with three points emerging on top. My best guess was that it was a flame. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t a doubt in my mind, this had to have been carved by my uncle. He must\u2019ve left this for me to find him. \n\nBelieving I was getting closer, I rushed back to the path down the stream without haste, I knew he had to be close by. Up ahead I could see a clearing, could this have been it? \n\nI emerged from the trees to find a pond ending at a small waterfall; the remainder of the stream now leading into the mountains. Unfortunately, there was no sign of any settlement. \n\nI was so certain though. He has to be in the vicinity, who else could\u2019ve carved that emblem? \n\n Exhausted, I decided to stop once more and head down to the water\u2019s edge for another drink. I crouched over and scooped up handfuls of water, guzzling it. I wasn\u2019t alone however. \n\nOut from the brush about 5 animals, one adult and 4 infants, appeared and treaded on down to the edge of the pond on the other side. They were similar to a pig in stature, but possessed a beak similar to a parrot\u2019s. \n\nInstinctively, I pulled out the notebook and cassette player, #4 referring me to the creature. \n\n*Part of the ceratopsid family; the horned dinosaurs, Choerumimus scrofa, the Hogbird, is a small forest-dwelling herbivore. It scours the forest floor, gorging on woody plants, bark, and roots. A shy animal, it is named for its similarities in behavior to wild pigs.* \n\nSeemingly a mother and offspring, they proceeded to the water for a drink. Not even seeming to acknowledge my existence. \n\nAside from the hogbirds and myself, it didn\u2019t seem like there was much activity at the pond. \n\nIn fact; things felt a little too quiet. \n\nThe sounds of the birds that filled the forest earlier had now ceased. It all felt suspicious. \n\nUnanticipatedly, the tree adjacent to the hogbird family, it\u2026moved. No, that was no tree. With a lightning fast reaction a massive bill shot down and grabbed one of the younger animals. The screaming infant struggled, calling out in fear, as a massive giraffe-like animal, with the head of a stork shook it violently. The other hogbirds fled, jetting off into the woods. The giant creature lifted its head back, and swallowed its catch whole. I swore I could see it go down the gullet. \n\nThis..thing, it was terrifying. Legs like stilts, a long, slender neck, and dark, reddish eyes that gave off a look of insatiable hunger. \n\nThen I realized. - I\u2019ve seen this animal before. It was the one from the petroglyphs engraved into the rock bluff. Could one of them some time ago have crossed over into our universe? \n\nIt then strided off into the woods. Lucky for me, it seemed it\u2019d had its fill. \n\nI picked up the notebook, and next to #7, was a sketch that vaguely resembled the petroglyphs. I skipped ahead on the cassette player to listen. \n\n*Messoropteryx daemoniensis; the Wood Reaper is a gargantuan pterosaur the size of a giraffe; and the apex predator of the conifer forests. They descend from the Ahzdarchids of the Late Cretaceous, a group that includes the famous \u2018Quetzalcoatlus\u2019, but have given up flight all together to become ground-based hunters. Utilizing ambush, their dark brown coloration allows them to blend into the forest, remaining motionless for unsuspecting prey to walk by, and then striking it with their massive bill. Prey is often swallowed whole, much like a stork or heron.* \n\nThe fact these things stand motionless, pretending to be trees made me all the more terrified. To think one of them actually wandered through that portal into our reality. I could only imagine what the people who encountered this thing felt. \n\nNot wanting to stick around with that stork-monster about, I decided to leave. \n\nI still had no lead on the location of my uncle. At this point it was starting to feel hopeless. But given the carving on the tree though, he had to be somewhere in the forest. Was he even still alive? \n\nThen another possibility came to me - higher ground. Perhaps he decided to set up camp on one of the mountain slopes, away from the dangers down below. Come to think of it, the waterfall had been flowing from higher elevation. Anybody living up there would likely have easy access to drinking water. \n\nI changed course and headed for the foothills of the mountain. \n\nI would first need to rejuvenate before I did, so I decided to stop and rest yet again. Up ahead, what looked like a barren tree seemed ideal. Without hesitation, I walked over and rested my arm on the trunk; a decision I would come to regret.. \n\nThe tree, within seconds of physical contact, moved. Of course it wasn\u2019t a tree, how was I that stupid? \n\nI looked up to see the ravenous glare of a wood reaper. The beast let out a deep bellow like some giant demonic goose, and thrusted its head downward. I barely moved out of the way, as it missed me by several inches. \n\nFast as I could I made a break for it, plowing through the endless patches of ferns. As I ran I could hear the reaper giving chase. It\u2019s freakishly long legs drumming the ground behind me. The damn thing was literally galloping. \n\nWith rapid thinking I made some sharp turns, which gave me a little more distance. I kept running, focusing on getting away with my life. To my misfortune, I hit a dead end - a flat wall of rock too vertical to climb. \n\nAs I turn to face my pursuer, I could see it, creeping around the corner of a tree, gradually closing in on me. Before I knew it this thing was no more than 3 meters away. \n\nThe reaper raised its head to strike, but out of nowhere, an object collided with its head; exploding on impact. A swarm of wasps was now marauding the creature, stinging it in vulnerable areas. The reaper let out a painful bellow, running off into the forest in agonizing pain.\n\nFor a moment; things went silent. I just witnessed a wasp nest get chucked at a giant murder-bird. It had to have been thrown\u2026by somebody. \n\nI looked up in all directions - no sign of anybody around, but as I did, something jumped down from behind me. \n\nWhen I turned around, I was greeted to a small creature, one that resembled a giant owl - but with arms, and a tail. It was roughly chest-high. \n\nThe most insane deatail; several pieces of jewelry hung around its neck. There was no mistake, whatever this thing was, it was sapient. \n\nThe hairy, or moreso feathered creature strutted over to me, not out of malice, but curiosity. It turned its head rapidly several times in a manor just like a bird, analyzing me up close. \n\nUnexpectedly, another one darted out from behind me, this one instead possessing a harness of some sort, that held a pouch against its chest. It too came up to study me. \n\nThe two of them circled me, eager to know what this strange skin-creature before them was. \n\nAfterwards, they congregated in front of me, making a series of chirps, hisses, and grunts to one another, no doubt their language. For about 5 minutes they \u2018spoke\u2019 to each other. Until eventually they looked at me, gesturing with their heads. One didn\u2019t have to be a linguist to understand that they wanted me to follow them. \n\nNeither of them acted truly aggressive toward me. Could my uncle have been living with these creatures? I felt I might stand a better chance of finding him if I came with, thus, I fell in line behind my two escorts. \n\nThe two \u2018birdmen\u2019 led me around the foothills of the mountain, circling the steep, purportedly unclimbable walls of rock. The more I looked at them, the more intrigued I became - could dinosaurs really have evolved society in this universe? Or even civilization? \n\nNaturally, the notebook must\u2019ve contained the answer to such a question. \n\nI opened it on the go, and there at #8 was a sketch reminiscent of my guides. I reached for the cassette player and started the next recording. \n\n*In a world without humans, non-avian dinosaurs would take up the mantle as a sapient species. This would lead to the development of the \u2018Ornithoids\u2019. Descending from a lineage of dinosaurs known as \u2018Thescelosaurids\u2019, a group of small, fast moving herbivores known in the fossil record for their burrowing habits, they have now entered a Stone Age, utilizing both stone and wooden tools for their everyday affairs. Their anatomy has drastically changed, once possessing a roadrunner-like appearance, they now have a build very similar to a burrowing owl; standing in a semi-upright gait, with arms possessing dexterous wrists. Living high up on mountain slopes, they venture down into the forest below only to forage for fruits, nuts and insects. Benign entities; their customs forbid acts of violence, baring life-threatening situations. I myself was able to befriend a tribe established along the slopes of what in our world is the Guadalupe Mountain Range, over time earning their trust. For a time, I lived amongst them, learning their ways, understanding how they perceived the world around them. Both of our realities occur at the same time, suggesting that the Ornithoids were able to avoid many of the mistakes humanity had made. The environment around them still flourished, a stark contrast to what\u2019s happening in our own timeline.* \n\nNot only was there an advanced society of dinosaurs in this version of our own world, but, they were peaceful, reasonable beings. On top of it all, I finally knew where my uncle had been these past two decades. \n\nI looked up to notice that the two Ornithoids escorting me stopped in their tracks. We were at a steep slope of jagged rocks. Both of them looking up towards the peak. The first one extended its legs and lifted off the ground, leaping onto the rocks; almost like a bird taking off. I watched them grip the rocks tightly scaling the near-vertical surface like it was nothing. \n\nMy other companion looked at me, gesturing me to continue following them. He led me towards a walkable, but treacherous ledge. Each step I took was carefully calculated, I mean, imagine coming all this way just to fall to your doom.. \n\nIt took a good 45 minutes, but upon arrival, we stood at the foot of a wall of vegetation, hanging down its face was a collection of vine-like plants. My feathered escort ran toward the wall, disappearing into the green. It was apparently a hidden passage of sorts. Without a second thought I went after them, taking me into what looked like a cave, but there was a light around the corner. I scaled the semi-steep path, and when I got to the end, there it was. \n\nA whole village of them nestled on the side of the mountain, overlooking the entire valley. Dozens of ornithoids were living here; their homes looked like hordes of branches and sticks weaved together, much like a birds\u2019 nest. \n\nMy presence was soon made evident, as many of them now fixated their attention on me. A reaction that was somewhat warranted, for as far as I knew, they\u2019ve only ever seen one other human, who was almost certainly here. Realizing that fact, I was anxious to finally see him. \n\nThe two individuals that led me here appeared before me, and again gestured to me to follow them. The three of us came upon the largest of the \u2018nest houses\u2019 at the center of the village, from the \u2018doorway\u2019 hung all sorts of woven ornaments. \n\nOnce inside, there, sat atop what looked like a large nest, was an ornithoid with much darker gray plumage, their arms folded against their chest like wings. Atop their head was a crown of ornamental vegetation sewn together, and around their neck hung all sorts of vivid jewelry. Obviously, this individual was the village leader or chief. \n\nThe two that led me here approached the old-timer, squawking and chirping up a storm. With a guttural hiss, they were silenced by their elder, who then gestured to them, signaling the pair to leave. \n\nAfter they exited the hut, the old, birdlike figure rose from their nest, and slowly approached, until they were right in front of me. \n\nWhat happened next, I never saw coming.. \n\n\u201cIt would seem you\u2019ve found yourself in quite the predicament, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI was completely speechless. In a surprising twist of events the village chief spoke to me - in perfect English. His voice very similar to a raven or parrot, but much deeper and more reserved. \n\n\u201cH-how, do you know my language, and more importantly how can you speak it?\u201d I asked. \n\nThe chief looked at me, knowing i\u2019d be surprised. \n\n\u201cAstonishing as it may seem, you are not the first otherworldly mammalian we\u2019ve encountered. Our kind has a unique ability to \u2018imitate\u2019 the sounds we hear.\u201d \n\nI was confident I knew who he was referring to. \n\n\u201cI apologize if my grandchildren caused you any trouble on the way here.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot at all\u201d I replied. \n\n\u201cIn fact, they saved my life.\u201d\n\nWanting to know more about this \u2018other human\u2019, I asked. \n\n\u201cYou mentioned somebody else like me. Who were they\u201d? \n\nTo which he replied:\n\n\u201cMany seasons ago another one of your kind came to our lands. While cautious at first, we realized they posed no threat. In accordance to our ways, we take the time to understand that which is unknown to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cFear, is the path to ignorance.\u201d He stated. \n\n\u201cWe took them in, taught them our ways, learned everything we could from them.\u201d \n\nThe chief then looked me directly in the eye. \n\n\u201cWhat is your name stranger\u201d? \n\n\u201cMy name is Henry.\u201d I told him. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come here looking for Dr. Carl Wilkinson.\u201d \n\nThe chief looked at me in shock. There was a look of sorrow in his eyes. \n\n\u201cI had long anticipated your arrival, Henry. I had known for a time that this day would come.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d? I asked. \n\nHis head hung, looking as if a tragedy had just occurred. \n\n\u201cCome my boy, there\u2019s something I must show you..\u201d \n\nThe Chief led me outside, we walked through the village until we reached a cavern, into which we entered. \n\nOnce inside, there was a whole row of mounds, the corridor illuminated by a set of torches. Each had a wooden staff protruding from their center. Mounted at the top of the poles were the skulls of assorted ornithoids. Clearly this was a crypt. \n\n\u201cThese are the halls of our deceased.\u201d Explained the chief. \n\n\u201cOnce we pass on, we are laid to rest here.\u201d \n\nThe skulls, inferred to be from the individuals buried in each plot, were the most interesting part, no doubt a part of their culture. \n\n\u201cWith respect, may I ask why it is that you display the skulls of your dead in this manner\u201d? \n\n\u201cThat is how we honor their memory. And so that their spirits can return to this realm to commune with their kin.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe dead..talk to you\u201d? \n\n\u201cNot in the way you may think.\u201d He explained. \n\n\u201cTo commune with the fallen, one must be attuned to their surroundings, and learn to listen to the land.\u201d \n\nI was never a religious guy, but I was amazed at how complex their culture was. 66 million years of evolution, and dinosaurs have not only continued to thrive, but have evolved advanced ways of life, much like humanity did, only without any of the horrific events that occurred in our own timeline. At least as far as I knew.. \n\nWe walked to the far end of the crypt. Atop the staff - was a human skull. \n\n\u201cCarl was an intelligent and benevolent soul. And he was a good friend.\u201d \n\nThe chief turned to face me. \n\n\u201cI am..terribly sorry.\u201d \n\nI had no words. After all this time searching, the man I came for\u2026was gone.\n\nI dropped to my knees. A feeling of emptiness engulfed me. I had no idea why. I hardly knew Carl, we practically never saw each other, so why? Why did I feel this way. \n\nThe chief put his scaly hand on my shoulder. \n\n\u201cIn the time he lived here, Carl had been planning for seasons, waiting for your arrival, to share this place with you. Share what he learned with one of his own. Once accomplished, he was to accompany you back to your realm.\u201d \n\nGiven what I\u2019d heard from his recordings, all he wanted, was for somebody to believe him this whole time. I at first merely dismissed him as a quiet, bizarre man who never made time for family. But all these years, he wanted to come home. \n\nI got up, and looked at my uncle\u2019s mounted skull, wishing I could talk to him. Then I turned to face the chief to ask another question. \n\n\u201cHow did he die\u201d? \n\nThe elderly birdman was quiet at first, but then spoke. \n\n\u201cHe was felled\u2026at the hands of the scorched.\u201d \n\nThe scorched? Who did he mean exactly? \n\nHe continued: \n\n\u201cNone know where they came from, but several seasons ago, a strange tribe entered our lands; much like us, but different. At first they were merely observers, but soon enough; they attacked. They burnt the land using their branches of fire, attacked our kind, leaving cinders and ash in their wake.\u201d \n\nThen my brain clicked. The emblem on the tree from earlier\u2026 \n\n\u201cIn the forest, I saw a carving, one that looked like a flame, was that their work\u201d? \n\nThe Chief unexpectedly recoiled. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re here\u201d He said in a concerned tone of voice. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer safe for you here, we need to return you to your realm.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut why\u201d? I asked. \n\n\u201cThe scorched have returned. If they find you, they will surely kill you\u2026or perhaps worse.\u201d\n\nHis description of these other beings sounded serious, but there was still a problem.  \n\n\u201cI came here through the other side of the valley, who knows how long it\u2019ll take us to get there.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe have our ways my boy, worry not.\u201d\n\nUltimately, I complied. But not without facing my uncle one last time. \n\nI looked at his skull, and paid my final respects. In a way I made peace with him. \n\nAlmost as soon as I came the chief and his grandchildren safely guided me back down to the foot of the mountain. When we did, I still had no idea how I was going to cover all that ground in such a short amount of time. \n\nThe chief looked over to his progenies and nodded. This signaled them both to let out a loud cackle, that echoed throughout the forest. For a minute, there was nothing. But soon enough running our way were three large bipeds. A trio of horse-sized dinosaurs that were much like ostriches in appearance, only with a long tail, stopped, right in front of us, before reaching down to nuzzle the two young ornithoids. \n\n\u201cThey will take you to the other side of the valley. None are their equal in speed.\u201d \n\nIt didn\u2019t take me long to notice that there were only three of them. \n\n\u201cAre you, not coming with us\u201d? I asked the chief. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I must stay here.\u201d He said. \n\n\u201cMy responsibility is to our village, and to keep our kind safe.\u201d \n\n\u201cI understand, but what\u2019s gonna happen? Will you be safe\u201d? \n\n\u201cPlacid as we are, self defense is nothing strange to us. We shall lay down our lives to defend our lands, and our kind.\u201d \n\nThe ostrich creatures knelt down, which promoted the chief\u2019s grandkids onto their backs. It was time to go. \n\nI carefully climbed onto the back of the third animal, positioning myself as one would with a horse. As it stood up, I could feel myself rushed into the air. Thing\u2019s back was quite sturdy. \n\nI looked down at the chief one last time. \n\n\u201cThank you, for everything.\u201d \n\n\u201cMay the ancestors guide you to safety.\u201d He said in response. \n\nMy fellow mountees let out another call, sending our steeds into a sprint. I could feel the air rushing past my head. Trees, ferns, and rocks all zipped past me. \n\nIt only took about 25 minutes to reach the forest\u2019s edge. Before I knew it I was back on the open plains. \n\nWhile we rode, I couldn\u2019t shake the thought of the aforementioned Scorched, the ones who killed my uncle. The way they were described by the chief painted them as dangerous entities, ones that weaponized fire. But just who, or what were they exactly? \n\nIn time we reached the center of the valley; halfway there, but time was running out. I noticed the sun, making its way down to the horizon. This put me on the timer, as the portal would soon close, trapping me here for a whole week. \n\nSuddenly however, an object came flying out in front of us. What looked like a flaming spear struck the ground; lighting it on fire. The impact of which frightened our steeds and sent them running adjacent. Another one landed in front of us, setting the ground ablaze, once more causing them to change direction. \n\nWe were now at top speed toward the other end of the valley. It wasn\u2019t long before more flaming spears were chucked at us from behind, just barely, but fortunately missing. \n\nOff to the side, I could make out movement in the grass. Whoever was chasing us, was also lighting quick. \n\nA dark figure then erupted from cover into the air. I only saw them for a brief moment, but got a good enough look to make out their appearance. \n\nThey looked like giant crows or ravens, only with a longer tail, hook-shaped talons on each foot, and a head that looked like some unholy cross between a lizard and a vulture. Their bodies were adorned with a variety of jewelry and tribal piercings. \n\nNearly there, just a little bit further. My mind focused only on the destination. \n\nAnother one lept out of the grass and chucked a spear from its mouth right in front of us. The impact of which spooked our mount, causing me to fall off. \n\nFrightened, my only mode of transportation ran off. \n\nA growing flame started rising in front of me.  I immediately jumped to my feet, but out from behind me, two of them emerged. They slowly crept toward me, hissing and clicking with their talons. Their bright yellow eyes making contact with mine. My heartbeat skyrocketed; something they could clearly pick up on. They \u2018enjoyed\u2019 my fear. \n\nBefore they could advance further on me, Something small and reddish in color hit one of them; exploding into a cloud of red dust. My attackers began to shriek and choke in agonizing pain. One of the chief\u2019s grandkids rode past, throwing another. The timing of which allowed me to escape. \n\nThe other young ornithoid rode up toward me, the ostrich creature kneeling down. I climbed on as fast as I could, and we took off. \n\nIt couldn\u2019t run as fast as before, now that it was carrying two passengers, but it was just enough to cover large tracks of ground. As I looked behind us I could see the prairie burning, the flames continuing to spread. I could only hope the chief\u2019s other progeny was ok. \n\nFollowing that ordeal, it didn\u2019t take long for us to arrive at our destination. We dismounted; our speedy ally proceeding to run off back into the grasslands. \n\nMy feathered companion bobbed their head at me, gesturing that I follow. However, this wasn\u2019t exactly the way I came down, instead it was a small ravine. A shortcut maybe? Nonetheless I followed. \n\nI looked up once more, and the sun was nearly about to set. I knew I needed to get my ass moving. \n\nMy guide led me through the ravine, safely navigating the bends and divots. \n\nFinally, there it was, exactly as I had left it. \n\nI turned to face my avian usher. I knew they didn\u2019t exactly know English, so I just decided  to nod to them, to which they did the same in response.\n\nI slowly walked over to the portal, relieved to finally go home - or so I thought. \n\nA shadowy figure kicked me, and I plummeted to the ground. It was another one of them; the Scorched. The things that killed my uncle. \n\nThis one was missing an eye, in fact half their face looked like it was singed off. Its snout possessed what looked like some sort of marking, reminiscent of a tribal tattoo. With an ominous stare it readied itself to pounce. \n\nIts talons lifted off the Earth, but was stopped midair by another figure ramming into it - the chief\u2019s progeny. \n\nThey wrestled my assailant; and as they did, they gave me one last look, and shrieked. I needed no translation, they were telling me to go; NOW. \n\nThe sun had set, and the portal was beginning to flicker. It was now or never. I barreled right through the portal. \n\nIn the blink of an eye it contracted. \n\nI was back in the desert, in my universe. The top of the bluff was lit, by the rising sun. \n\nIt\u2019s been roughly 8 months since all of this went down. Not a day has gone by where I haven\u2019t thought about my excursion. More importantly; the ornithoids. What was going to happen to them? The two who guided me through all those perils were the one\u2019s I worried about most. If not for them, I wouldn\u2019t have made it back, or still be alive for that matter. Who knows what happened to them though? It pains me to think about what horrible things the scorched would do to them. \n\nBy now however, the portals won\u2019t open again for another 20 years. Meaning all I can hope to do; is pray, that the ornithoids would be ok. But What if I didn\u2019t? What if there was a way to reopen the portals manually without having to wait another two decades? Ideas which crossed my mind not too long ago\n\nMy uncle spent years studying these gateways to other realities; what if there was hypothetically a way to open one? \n\nSooner or later, I\u2019ll come back for his research; try to better understand how it all works. I have since vowed to figure it out, so that I may return. ",

Constantly scrolling on the internet every day 24/7.\n\n45. Stuttering. (I've never had a stutter.)\n\n46. I don't wake up feeling refreshed.\n\n47. Pacing up and down around the house. I used to grip Mt hair meanwhile doing this due to the weird sensations.\n\n48. Feeling a sudden rush of weird sensations and they would go away after a few seconds.\n\n49.

I don't even have to be anxious/scared etc. Their always there.\n\nI do have my up's and downs. Sometimes my symptoms are good. Sometimes their bad. But a lot of time their just there.\n\n\nwhat does this mean for me? I've never had health issues, I've always been healthy, happy, and I have no history of medical issues, especially constant stomach issues. I'm only 16, and the symptoms are not getting progressively worse. Their stable.\n\nI already know the possible moot cause. (The things I went through, and possibly some deficiencies? Because again they abruptly started when i was going through things and they havent left.)\n\nAfter going through that, I haven't been the same. I'm not the same happy confident kid I used to be.\n\nI do wanna go on walks, almost daily, etc etc. But im terrified. What if I throw up because my constant gut/digestive symptoms get bad? What if something bad happens to me when I'm bathing? What if something is wrong with me medically??\n\nI have had times in my childhood, where I would gag for no reason. I would feel shaky, and have a dry mouth, and feeling like throwing up for no reason in hospitals, restaurants etc. I even gagged at my grandparents house for no reason. Didn't feel nauseous or anything.\n\nA month ago back in early February. I was getting my hair cut by my cousin, and I felt shaky, I was getting weird sensations, I wanted to stop and get out the chair. But I didn't and I just pushed through and it was worth it in the end.\n\n\nI'm scared. And I need some reassuring. I am waiting to see if me and my family get an new doctor, and then I'll try and get a therapist or a psychiatrist. \n\nBut the constant physical symptoms daily etc? Does this mean that I could have a anxiety disorder ?\n\nI don't know if I forgot anymore symptoms. But I can remember some then I'll edit this. Because I think I've had a lot more symptoms along side these from what I remember.\n\nBut im still scared that it's a physical issue, due to how constant the symptoms are. Like the gut/digestive symptoms? Constant. The other symptoms? Some constant, and most were short-lived etc. But their not getting progressively worse though. \n\nBut im so scared. Because I don't know if I got my symptoms right etc. I'm scared that I'm never gonna get better again. And I'm so tired.",

        "title": "I Discovered a Parallel Reality where Dinosaurs Never went Extinct.. Part 2",
        "selftext": "Out of the plains and into the woods. I was now traveling through a dense mosaic of conifers. The trees towering above me, baring an uncanny resemblance to the sequoias in California. \n\nNow I just needed to figure out where my uncle was, that is, if he had even settled here. I didn\u2019t stray too far from the stream, if there was any sign of somebody living here, i\u2019d imagine they\u2019d be close to water. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that everything in this version of Earth felt, bigger. The plants, the animals, simply the overall scale of this reality, it was enormous. \n\nThe hulking trees towered above me like buildings. Emanating from the canopy were the sounds of various birds, many of which sounded like nothing i\u2019d ever heard before. The forest floor was blanketed in groves of ferns, primeval in appearance. \n\nWhile continuing my way upstream, I regularly kept a sharp eye out for anything manmade. Some of the trees had massive; gaping holes in them, not dissimilar to the redwood forests of the pacific coast in our own timeline. I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d make an ideal place to camp out, although probably not for twenty years. While thinking about it, I came to a complete stop. \n\nNow I don\u2019t know what it was at the time, but something didn\u2019t sit right. I could feel a presence, not of an animal, no. This felt very different. \n\nSomething, or someone, was watching me. \n\nYet no matter where I looked, there was nothing. It\u2019s as if the trees themselves had eyes. \n\nPerhaps I was just on edge. I brushed it off, albeit reluctantly, and continued about my business. \n\nI followed the stream for what seemed like hours, but to no avail, did I find any sign of human presence. That, unexpectedly, would soon change. \n\nRight away, I caught a glimpse of something odd on the bark of a tree. The discovery of which piqued my curiosity. \n\nI went in for a closer look, and when I did, my eyes widened. Carved into the trunk of this conifer was some sort of image. The image looked like some sort of crest or sigil, circular with three points emerging on top. My best guess was that it was a flame. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t a doubt in my mind, this had to have been carved by my uncle. He must\u2019ve left this for me to find him. \n\nBelieving I was getting closer, I rushed back to the path down the stream without haste, I knew he had to be close by. Up ahead I could see a clearing, could this have been it? \n\nI emerged from the trees to find a pond ending at a small waterfall; the remainder of the stream now leading into the mountains. Unfortunately, there was no sign of any settlement. \n\nI was so certain though. He has to be in the vicinity, who else could\u2019ve carved that emblem? \n\n Exhausted, I decided to stop once more and head down to the water\u2019s edge for another drink. I crouched over and scooped up handfuls of water, guzzling it. I wasn\u2019t alone however. \n\nOut from the brush about 5 animals, one adult and 4 infants, appeared and treaded on down to the edge of the pond on the other side. They were similar to a pig in stature, but possessed a beak similar to a parrot\u2019s. \n\nInstinctively, I pulled out the notebook and cassette player, #4 referring me to the creature. \n\n*Part of the ceratopsid family; the horned dinosaurs, Choerumimus scrofa, the Hogbird, is a small forest-dwelling herbivore. It scours the forest floor, gorging on woody plants, bark, and roots. A shy animal, it is named for its similarities in behavior to wild pigs.* \n\nSeemingly a mother and offspring, they proceeded to the water for a drink. Not even seeming to acknowledge my existence. \n\nAside from the hogbirds and myself, it didn\u2019t seem like there was much activity at the pond. \n\nIn fact; things felt a little too quiet. \n\nThe sounds of the birds that filled the forest earlier had now ceased. It all felt suspicious. \n\nUnanticipatedly, the tree adjacent to the hogbird family, it\u2026moved. No, that was no tree. With a lightning fast reaction a massive bill shot down and grabbed one of the younger animals. The screaming infant struggled, calling out in fear, as a massive giraffe-like animal, with the head of a stork shook it violently. The other hogbirds fled, jetting off into the woods. The giant creature lifted its head back, and swallowed its catch whole. I swore I could see it go down the gullet. \n\nThis..thing, it was terrifying. Legs like stilts, a long, slender neck, and dark, reddish eyes that gave off a look of insatiable hunger. \n\nThen I realized. - I\u2019ve seen this animal before. It was the one from the petroglyphs engraved into the rock bluff. Could one of them some time ago have crossed over into our universe? \n\nIt then strided off into the woods. Lucky for me, it seemed it\u2019d had its fill. \n\nI picked up the notebook, and next to #7, was a sketch that vaguely resembled the petroglyphs. I skipped ahead on the cassette player to listen. \n\n*Messoropteryx daemoniensis; the Wood Reaper is a gargantuan pterosaur the size of a giraffe; and the apex predator of the conifer forests. They descend from the Ahzdarchids of the Late Cretaceous, a group that includes the famous \u2018Quetzalcoatlus\u2019, but have given up flight all together to become ground-based hunters. Utilizing ambush, their dark brown coloration allows them to blend into the forest, remaining motionless for unsuspecting prey to walk by, and then striking it with their massive bill. Prey is often swallowed whole, much like a stork or heron.* \n\nThe fact these things stand motionless, pretending to be trees made me all the more terrified. To think one of them actually wandered through that portal into our reality. I could only imagine what the people who encountered this thing felt. \n\nNot wanting to stick around with that stork-monster about, I decided to leave. \n\nI still had no lead on the location of my uncle. At this point it was starting to feel hopeless. But given the carving on the tree though, he had to be somewhere in the forest. Was he even still alive? \n\nThen another possibility came to me - higher ground. Perhaps he decided to set up camp on one of the mountain slopes, away from the dangers down below. Come to think of it, the waterfall had been flowing from higher elevation. Anybody living up there would likely have easy access to drinking water. \n\nI changed course and headed for the foothills of the mountain. \n\nI would first need to rejuvenate before I did, so I decided to stop and rest yet again. Up ahead, what looked like a barren tree seemed ideal. Without hesitation, I walked over and rested my arm on the trunk; a decision I would come to regret.. \n\nThe tree, within seconds of physical contact, moved. Of course it wasn\u2019t a tree, how was I that stupid? \n\nI looked up to see the ravenous glare of a wood reaper. The beast let out a deep bellow like some giant demonic goose, and thrusted its head downward. I barely moved out of the way, as it missed me by several inches. \n\nFast as I could I made a break for it, plowing through the endless patches of ferns. As I ran I could hear the reaper giving chase. It\u2019s freakishly long legs drumming the ground behind me. The damn thing was literally galloping. \n\nWith rapid thinking I made some sharp turns, which gave me a little more distance. I kept running, focusing on getting away with my life. To my misfortune, I hit a dead end - a flat wall of rock too vertical to climb. \n\nAs I turn to face my pursuer, I could see it, creeping around the corner of a tree, gradually closing in on me. Before I knew it this thing was no more than 3 meters away. \n\nThe reaper raised its head to strike, but out of nowhere, an object collided with its head; exploding on impact. A swarm of wasps was now marauding the creature, stinging it in vulnerable areas. The reaper let out a painful bellow, running off into the forest in agonizing pain.\n\nFor a moment; things went silent. I just witnessed a wasp nest get chucked at a giant murder-bird. It had to have been thrown\u2026by somebody. \n\nI looked up in all directions - no sign of anybody around, but as I did, something jumped down from behind me. \n\nWhen I turned around, I was greeted to a small creature, one that resembled a giant owl - but with arms, and a tail. It was roughly chest-high. \n\nThe most insane deatail; several pieces of jewelry hung around its neck. There was no mistake, whatever this thing was, it was sapient. \n\nThe hairy, or moreso feathered creature strutted over to me, not out of malice, but curiosity. It turned its head rapidly several times in a manor just like a bird, analyzing me up close. \n\nUnexpectedly, another one darted out from behind me, this one instead possessing a harness of some sort, that held a pouch against its chest. It too came up to study me. \n\nThe two of them circled me, eager to know what this strange skin-creature before them was. \n\nAfterwards, they congregated in front of me, making a series of chirps, hisses, and grunts to one another, no doubt their language. For about 5 minutes they \u2018spoke\u2019 to each other. Until eventually they looked at me, gesturing with their heads. One didn\u2019t have to be a linguist to understand that they wanted me to follow them. \n\nNeither of them acted truly aggressive toward me. Could my uncle have been living with these creatures? I felt I might stand a better chance of finding him if I came with, thus, I fell in line behind my two escorts. \n\nThe two \u2018birdmen\u2019 led me around the foothills of the mountain, circling the steep, purportedly unclimbable walls of rock. The more I looked at them, the more intrigued I became - could dinosaurs really have evolved society in this universe? Or even civilization? \n\nNaturally, the notebook must\u2019ve contained the answer to such a question. \n\nI opened it on the go, and there at #8 was a sketch reminiscent of my guides. I reached for the cassette player and started the next recording. \n\n*In a world without humans, non-avian dinosaurs would take up the mantle as a sapient species. This would lead to the development of the \u2018Ornithoids\u2019. Descending from a lineage of dinosaurs known as \u2018Thescelosaurids\u2019, a group of small, fast moving herbivores known in the fossil record for their burrowing habits, they have now entered a Stone Age, utilizing both stone and wooden tools for their everyday affairs. Their anatomy has drastically changed, once possessing a roadrunner-like appearance, they now have a build very similar to a burrowing owl; standing in a semi-upright gait, with arms possessing dexterous wrists. Living high up on mountain slopes, they venture down into the forest below only to forage for fruits, nuts and insects. Benign entities; their customs forbid acts of violence, baring life-threatening situations. I myself was able to befriend a tribe established along the slopes of what in our world is the Guadalupe Mountain Range, over time earning their trust. For a time, I lived amongst them, learning their ways, understanding how they perceived the world around them. Both of our realities occur at the same time, suggesting that the Ornithoids were able to avoid many of the mistakes humanity had made. The environment around them still flourished, a stark contrast to what\u2019s happening in our own timeline.* \n\nNot only was there an advanced society of dinosaurs in this version of our own world, but, they were peaceful, reasonable beings. On top of it all, I finally knew where my uncle had been these past two decades. \n\nI looked up to notice that the two Ornithoids escorting me stopped in their tracks. We were at a steep slope of jagged rocks. Both of them looking up towards the peak. The first one extended its legs and lifted off the ground, leaping onto the rocks; almost like a bird taking off. I watched them grip the rocks tightly scaling the near-vertical surface like it was nothing. \n\nMy other companion looked at me, gesturing me to continue following them. He led me towards a walkable, but treacherous ledge. Each step I took was carefully calculated, I mean, imagine coming all this way just to fall to your doom.. \n\nIt took a good 45 minutes, but upon arrival, we stood at the foot of a wall of vegetation, hanging down its face was a collection of vine-like plants. My feathered escort ran toward the wall, disappearing into the green. It was apparently a hidden passage of sorts. Without a second thought I went after them, taking me into what looked like a cave, but there was a light around the corner. I scaled the semi-steep path, and when I got to the end, there it was. \n\nA whole village of them nestled on the side of the mountain, overlooking the entire valley. Dozens of ornithoids were living here; their homes looked like hordes of branches and sticks weaved together, much like a birds\u2019 nest. \n\nMy presence was soon made evident, as many of them now fixated their attention on me. A reaction that was somewhat warranted, for as far as I knew, they\u2019ve only ever seen one other human, who was almost certainly here. Realizing that fact, I was anxious to finally see him. \n\nThe two individuals that led me here appeared before me, and again gestured to me to follow them. The three of us came upon the largest of the \u2018nest houses\u2019 at the center of the village, from the \u2018doorway\u2019 hung all sorts of woven ornaments. \n\nOnce inside, there, sat atop what looked like a large nest, was an ornithoid with much darker gray plumage, their arms folded against their chest like wings. Atop their head was a crown of ornamental vegetation sewn together, and around their neck hung all sorts of vivid jewelry. Obviously, this individual was the village leader or chief. \n\nThe two that led me here approached the old-timer, squawking and chirping up a storm. With a guttural hiss, they were silenced by their elder, who then gestured to them, signaling the pair to leave. \n\nAfter they exited the hut, the old, birdlike figure rose from their nest, and slowly approached, until they were right in front of me. \n\nWhat happened next, I never saw coming.. \n\n\u201cIt would seem you\u2019ve found yourself in quite the predicament, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI was completely speechless. In a surprising twist of events the village chief spoke to me - in perfect English. His voice very similar to a raven or parrot, but much deeper and more reserved. \n\n\u201cH-how, do you know my language, and more importantly how can you speak it?\u201d I asked. \n\nThe chief looked at me, knowing i\u2019d be surprised. \n\n\u201cAstonishing as it may seem, you are not the first otherworldly mammalian we\u2019ve encountered. Our kind has a unique ability to \u2018imitate\u2019 the sounds we hear.\u201d \n\nI was confident I knew who he was referring to. \n\n\u201cI apologize if my grandchildren caused you any trouble on the way here.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot at all\u201d I replied. \n\n\u201cIn fact, they saved my life.\u201d\n\nWanting to know more about this \u2018other human\u2019, I asked. \n\n\u201cYou mentioned somebody else like me. Who were they\u201d? \n\nTo which he replied:\n\n\u201cMany seasons ago another one of your kind came to our lands. While cautious at first, we realized they posed no threat. In accordance to our ways, we take the time to understand that which is unknown to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cFear, is the path to ignorance.\u201d He stated. \n\n\u201cWe took them in, taught them our ways, learned everything we could from them.\u201d \n\nThe chief then looked me directly in the eye. \n\n\u201cWhat is your name stranger\u201d? \n\n\u201cMy name is Henry.\u201d I told him. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come here looking for Dr. Carl Wilkinson.\u201d \n\nThe chief looked at me in shock. There was a look of sorrow in his eyes. \n\n\u201cI had long anticipated your arrival, Henry. I had known for a time that this day would come.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d? I asked. \n\nHis head hung, looking as if a tragedy had just occurred. \n\n\u201cCome my boy, there\u2019s something I must show you..\u201d \n\nThe Chief led me outside, we walked through the village until we reached a cavern, into which we entered. \n\nOnce inside, there was a whole row of mounds, the corridor illuminated by a set of torches. Each had a wooden staff protruding from their center. Mounted at the top of the poles were the skulls of assorted ornithoids. Clearly this was a crypt. \n\n\u201cThese are the halls of our deceased.\u201d Explained the chief. \n\n\u201cOnce we pass on, we are laid to rest here.\u201d \n\nThe skulls, inferred to be from the individuals buried in each plot, were the most interesting part, no doubt a part of their culture. \n\n\u201cWith respect, may I ask why it is that you display the skulls of your dead in this manner\u201d? \n\n\u201cThat is how we honor their memory. And so that their spirits can return to this realm to commune with their kin.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe dead..talk to you\u201d? \n\n\u201cNot in the way you may think.\u201d He explained. \n\n\u201cTo commune with the fallen, one must be attuned to their surroundings, and learn to listen to the land.\u201d \n\nI was never a religious guy, but I was amazed at how complex their culture was. 66 million years of evolution, and dinosaurs have not only continued to thrive, but have evolved advanced ways of life, much like humanity did, only without any of the horrific events that occurred in our own timeline. At least as far as I knew.. \n\nWe walked to the far end of the crypt. Atop the staff - was a human skull. \n\n\u201cCarl was an intelligent and benevolent soul. And he was a good friend.\u201d \n\nThe chief turned to face me. \n\n\u201cI am..terribly sorry.\u201d \n\nI had no words. After all this time searching, the man I came for\u2026was gone.\n\nI dropped to my knees. A feeling of emptiness engulfed me. I had no idea why. I hardly knew Carl, we practically never saw each other, so why? Why did I feel this way. \n\nThe chief put his scaly hand on my shoulder. \n\n\u201cIn the time he lived here, Carl had been planning for seasons, waiting for your arrival, to share this place with you. Share what he learned with one of his own. Once accomplished, he was to accompany you back to your realm.\u201d \n\nGiven what I\u2019d heard from his recordings, all he wanted, was for somebody to believe him this whole time. I at first merely dismissed him as a quiet, bizarre man who never made time for family. But all these years, he wanted to come home. \n\nI got up, and looked at my uncle\u2019s mounted skull, wishing I could talk to him. Then I turned to face the chief to ask another question. \n\n\u201cHow did he die\u201d? \n\nThe elderly birdman was quiet at first, but then spoke. \n\n\u201cHe was felled\u2026at the hands of the scorched.\u201d \n\nThe scorched? Who did he mean exactly? \n\nHe continued: \n\n\u201cNone know where they came from, but several seasons ago, a strange tribe entered our lands; much like us, but different. At first they were merely observers, but soon enough; they attacked. They burnt the land using their branches of fire, attacked our kind, leaving cinders and ash in their wake.\u201d \n\nThen my brain clicked. The emblem on the tree from earlier\u2026 \n\n\u201cIn the forest, I saw a carving, one that looked like a flame, was that their work\u201d? \n\nThe Chief unexpectedly recoiled. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re here\u201d He said in a concerned tone of voice. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer safe for you here, we need to return you to your realm.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut why\u201d? I asked. \n\n\u201cThe scorched have returned. If they find you, they will surely kill you\u2026or perhaps worse.\u201d\n\nHis description of these other beings sounded serious, but there was still a problem.  \n\n\u201cI came here through the other side of the valley, who knows how long it\u2019ll take us to get there.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe have our ways my boy, worry not.\u201d\n\nUltimately, I complied. But not without facing my uncle one last time. \n\nI looked at his skull, and paid my final respects. In a way I made peace with him. \n\nAlmost as soon as I came the chief and his grandchildren safely guided me back down to the foot of the mountain. When we did, I still had no idea how I was going to cover all that ground in such a short amount of time. \n\nThe chief looked over to his progenies and nodded. This signaled them both to let out a loud cackle, that echoed throughout the forest. For a minute, there was nothing. But soon enough running our way were three large bipeds. A trio of horse-sized dinosaurs that were much like ostriches in appearance, only with a long tail, stopped, right in front of us, before reaching down to nuzzle the two young ornithoids. \n\n\u201cThey will take you to the other side of the valley. None are their equal in speed.\u201d \n\nIt didn\u2019t take me long to notice that there were only three of them. \n\n\u201cAre you, not coming with us\u201d? I asked the chief. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I must stay here.\u201d He said. \n\n\u201cMy responsibility is to our village, and to keep our kind safe.\u201d \n\n\u201cI understand, but what\u2019s gonna happen? Will you be safe\u201d? \n\n\u201cPlacid as we are, self defense is nothing strange to us. We shall lay down our lives to defend our lands, and our kind.\u201d \n\nThe ostrich creatures knelt down, which promoted the chief\u2019s grandkids onto their backs. It was time to go. \n\nI carefully climbed onto the back of the third animal, positioning myself as one would with a horse. As it stood up, I could feel myself rushed into the air. Thing\u2019s back was quite sturdy. \n\nI looked down at the chief one last time. \n\n\u201cThank you, for everything.\u201d \n\n\u201cMay the ancestors guide you to safety.\u201d He said in response. \n\nMy fellow mountees let out another call, sending our steeds into a sprint. I could feel the air rushing past my head. Trees, ferns, and rocks all zipped past me. \n\nIt only took about 25 minutes to reach the forest\u2019s edge. Before I knew it I was back on the open plains. \n\nWhile we rode, I couldn\u2019t shake the thought of the aforementioned Scorched, the ones who killed my uncle. The way they were described by the chief painted them as dangerous entities, ones that weaponized fire. But just who, or what were they exactly? \n\nIn time we reached the center of the valley; halfway there, but time was running out. I noticed the sun, making its way down to the horizon. This put me on the timer, as the portal would soon close, trapping me here for a whole week. \n\nSuddenly however, an object came flying out in front of us. What looked like a flaming spear struck the ground; lighting it on fire. The impact of which frightened our steeds and sent them running adjacent. Another one landed in front of us, setting the ground ablaze, once more causing them to change direction. \n\nWe were now at top speed toward the other end of the valley. It wasn\u2019t long before more flaming spears were chucked at us from behind, just barely, but fortunately missing. \n\nOff to the side, I could make out movement in the grass. Whoever was chasing us, was also lighting quick. \n\nA dark figure then erupted from cover into the air. I only saw them for a brief moment, but got a good enough look to make out their appearance. \n\nThey looked like giant crows or ravens, only with a longer tail, hook-shaped talons on each foot, and a head that looked like some unholy cross between a lizard and a vulture. Their bodies were adorned with a variety of jewelry and tribal piercings. \n\nNearly there, just a little bit further. My mind focused only on the destination. \n\nAnother one lept out of the grass and chucked a spear from its mouth right in front of us. The impact of which spooked our mount, causing me to fall off. \n\nFrightened, my only mode of transportation ran off. \n\nA growing flame started rising in front of me.  I immediately jumped to my feet, but out from behind me, two of them emerged. They slowly crept toward me, hissing and clicking with their talons. Their bright yellow eyes making contact with mine. My heartbeat skyrocketed; something they could clearly pick up on. They \u2018enjoyed\u2019 my fear. \n\nBefore they could advance further on me, Something small and reddish in color hit one of them; exploding into a cloud of red dust. My attackers began to shriek and choke in agonizing pain. One of the chief\u2019s grandkids rode past, throwing another. The timing of which allowed me to escape. \n\nThe other young ornithoid rode up toward me, the ostrich creature kneeling down. I climbed on as fast as I could, and we took off. \n\nIt couldn\u2019t run as fast as before, now that it was carrying two passengers, but it was just enough to cover large tracks of ground. As I looked behind us I could see the prairie burning, the flames continuing to spread. I could only hope the chief\u2019s other progeny was ok. \n\nFollowing that ordeal, it didn\u2019t take long for us to arrive at our destination. We dismounted; our speedy ally proceeding to run off back into the grasslands. \n\nMy feathered companion bobbed their head at me, gesturing that I follow. However, this wasn\u2019t exactly the way I came down, instead it was a small ravine. A shortcut maybe? Nonetheless I followed. \n\nI looked up once more, and the sun was nearly about to set. I knew I needed to get my ass moving. \n\nMy guide led me through the ravine, safely navigating the bends and divots. \n\nFinally, there it was, exactly as I had left it. \n\nI turned to face my avian usher. I knew they didn\u2019t exactly know English, so I just decided  to nod to them, to which they did the same in response.\n\nI slowly walked over to the portal, relieved to finally go home - or so I thought. \n\nA shadowy figure kicked me, and I plummeted to the ground. It was another one of them; the Scorched. The things that killed my uncle. \n\nThis one was missing an eye, in fact half their face looked like it was singed off. Its snout possessed what looked like some sort of marking, reminiscent of a tribal tattoo. With an ominous stare it readied itself to pounce. \n\nIts talons lifted off the Earth, but was stopped midair by another figure ramming into it - the chief\u2019s progeny. \n\nThey wrestled my assailant; and as they did, they gave me one last look, and shrieked. I needed no translation, they were telling me to go; NOW. \n\nThe sun had set, and the portal was beginning to flicker. It was now or never. I barreled right through the portal. \n\nIn the blink of an eye it contracted. \n\nI was back in the desert, in my universe. The top of the bluff was lit, by the rising sun. \n\nIt\u2019s been roughly 8 months since all of this went down. Not a day has gone by where I haven\u2019t thought about my excursion. More importantly; the ornithoids. What was going to happen to them? The two who guided me through all those perils were the one\u2019s I worried about most. If not for them, I wouldn\u2019t have made it back, or still be alive for that matter. Who knows what happened to them though? It pains me to think about what horrible things the scorched would do to them. \n\nBy now however, the portals won\u2019t open again for another 20 years. Meaning all I can hope to do; is pray, that the ornithoids would be ok. But What if I didn\u2019t? What if there was a way to reopen the portals manually without having to wait another two decades? Ideas which crossed my mind not too long ago\n\nMy uncle spent years studying these gateways to other realities; what if there was hypothetically a way to open one? \n\nSooner or later, I\u2019ll come back for his research; try to better understand how it all works. I have since vowed to figure it out, so that I may return. ",
